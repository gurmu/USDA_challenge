text_by_page,"['Foodborne Pathogen Test Kits Validated by Independent Organizations FSIS is making available a list of test kits that have been validated for detection of relevant foodborne pathogens (i.e., Salmonella, Campylobacter, Listeria spp. including L. monocytogenes, E. coli O157:H7 and non-O157 STEC). The list is intended to be informational and is not an endorsement or approval of any specific test kit, regardless of its inclusion in the list. FSIS does not specifically endorse any of the mentioned test kits or products and acknowledges that equivalent test kits or products may be available for laboratory use. Likewise, FSIS does not require the use of any specific test kit, including those incorporated into FSIS’s Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook methods. Instead, establishments and laboratories should choose test kits that are: 1)Validated for testing relevant foods by a: a) Recognized independent body (i.e., AOAC, AFNOR, MicroVal, NordVal), b) U.S. regulatory body (i.e., FSIS MLG or FDA BAM), or c) International Organization for Standardization (ISO) process 2)In addition, the validated method should be: a)Fit for the intended purpose and application (e.g., validated for the appropriate matrix and sample size to detect the appropriate foodborne pathogen), and b)Performed per the conditions of the validated protocol by a laboratory that assures the quality of the analytical results. The table below contains a list of foodborne pathogen test kits that are validated by recognized independent organizations (i.e., AOAC, AFNOR, MicroVal, NordVal) and therefore meet criterion 1a above. However, the test kits in this list are not necessarily equivalent or appropriate for all testing applications. FSIS intends to update validated test kit lists on a quarterly basis. # Method Name Target Organism(s) Manufacturer External Validation Validated Matrices Validated Test Portion Size S001a 3M Molecular Detection Assay Salmonella (MDA 2) Salmonella spp. 3M Health Care AFNOR # 3M 01/16 - 11/16 All human food products (except spices, aromatic herbs, instant coffees and teas, bouillon cubes/concentrates, milk powders and cocoa powders) and environmental samples (except primary production stage environment) 25g S001c 3M™ Molecular Detection Assay (MDA) Salmonella Method Salmonella spp. 3M Food Safety AOAC-OMA # 2013.09 Raw ground beef (25g, 325g, 375g), cooked breaded chicken (325g), liquid egg (100g), shrimp, fresh spinach, and wet dog food (375g), raw ground chicken (25g, 325g), pasteurized american cheese, peanut butter, dry dog food (25g, 375g), sprout irrigation water (375g), chicken carcass rinse (30ml), chicken carcass sponge, sealed/glazed ceramic tile, concrete, stainless steel 25g except where noted in ""Validated Matrices"" S005a ANSR for Salmonella Salmonella enterica and Salmonella bongori Neogen Corporation AOAC-PTM # 061203 Raw ground beef, hot dogs (25g, 325g), chicken carcass rinse (30mL), raw ground turkey, oat cereal, surfaces (stainless steel, plastic, sealed concrete, ceramic tile rubber) 25g except where noted in ""Validated Matrices"" S005b ANSR for Salmonella Salmonella enterica Neogen Corporation AFNOR # NEO 35/02 - 05/13 Meat products, dairy products, seafood and vegetables 25g S006a Assurance GDS for Salmonella Tq Salmonella spp. BioControl Systems, Inc.

The list is intended to be informational and is not an endorsement or approval of any specific test kit, regardless of its inclusion in the list. FSIS does not specifically endorse any of the mentioned test kits or products and acknowledges that equivalent test kits or products may be available for laboratory use. Likewise, FSIS does not require the use of any specific test kit, including those incorporated into FSIS’s Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook methods. Instead, establishments and laboratories should choose test kits that are: 1)Validated for testing relevant foods by a: a) Recognized independent body (i.e., AOAC, AFNOR, MicroVal, NordVal), b) U.S. regulatory body (i.e., FSIS MLG or FDA BAM), or c) International Organization for Standardization (ISO) process 2)In addition, the validated method should be: a)Fit for the intended purpose and application (e.g., validated for the appropriate matrix and sample size to detect the appropriate foodborne pathogen), and b)Performed per the conditions of the validated protocol by a laboratory that assures the quality of the analytical results.

The list is intended to be informational and is not an endorsement or approval of any specific test kit, regardless of its inclusion in the list. FSIS does not specifically endorse any of the mentioned test kits or products and acknowledges that equivalent test kits or products may be available for laboratory use. Likewise, FSIS does not require the use of any specific test kit, including those incorporated into FSIS’s Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook methods. Instead, establishments and laboratories should choose test kits that are: 1)Validated for testing relevant foods by a: a)Recognized independent body (i.e., AOAC, AFNOR, MicroVal, NordVal), b)U.S. regulatory body (i.e., FSIS MLG or FDA BAM), or c) International Organization for Standardization (ISO) process 2)In addition, the validated method should be: a)Fit for the intended purpose and application (e.g., validated for the appropriate matrix and sample size to detect the appropriate foodborne pathogen), and b)Performed per the conditions of the validated protocol by a laboratory that assures the quality of the analytical results. The table below contains a list of foodborne pathogen test kits that are validated by recognized independent organizations (i.e., AOAC, AFNOR, MicroVal, NordVal) and therefore meet criterion 1a above. However, the test kits in this list are not necessarily equivalent or appropriate for all testing applications. FSIS intends to update validated test kit lists on a quarterly basis. # Method Name Target Organism(s) Manufacturer External Validation Validated matrices Validated Test Portion Size EC003 Assurance GDS for E. coli O157:H7 E. coli O157:H7 BioControl Systems AOAC-OMA # 2005.04 Raw ground beef, beef trim, orange juice, apple juice, fresh 25g EC004 Assurance GDS Shigatoxin Genes E. coli O157:H7 and E. coli O157:H7 nonmotile (NM) BioControl Systems AOAC-OMA # 2005.05 Raw ground beef, beef trim, orange juice, apple juice, fresh vegetables, and sprout process water 25g EC005 Assurance® Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA) E. coli O157:H7 (EHEC) BioControl Systems AOAC-OMA # 996.10 Dairy foods, meats, poultry products, fruits, nutmeats, seafood pasta liquid eggs 25g EC006a BAX System Real-Time PCR Assay E. coli O157:H7 E. coli O157 DuPont Qualicon (DuPont Nutrition & Health Diagnostics) AFNOR # QUA 18/07 - 07/10 Raw beef and raw vegetables 25g EC006b BAX System Real-Time PCR Assay for E. coli O157:H7 E. coli O157:H7 Hygiena AOAC-PTM # 031002 lettuce (25 g), spinach (25 g), beef trim (375 g) & ground beef (65 g) 25g except where noted in ""Validated Matrices"" EC007a BAX System PCR Assay for E. coli O157:H7 MP E. coli O157 DuPont Qualicon (DuPont Nutrition & Health Diagnostics) AFNOR # QUA 18/04 - 03/08 Raw beef meat, raw milk, fruits, vegetables, Ready-toEat meals, raw pork meat, raw 25g EC007b BAX System PCR Assay for E. coli O157:H7 MP BAX System X5 PCR Assay for E. coli O157:H7 (formerly DuPont BAX System PCR E. coli O157:H7 Hygiena AOAC-PTM # 050501 raw ground beef (25 g, 65 g), beef trim (65 g, 325 g, 375 g), spinach (25 g), lettuce (25 g), red leaf lettuce (200 g, 375 g) 25g except where noted in ""Validated Matrices"" ** N/A = Not available', '# Method Name Target Organism(s) Manufacturer External Validation Validated matrices Validated Test Portion Size EC010 BBL CHROMagar O157 E. coli O157:H7 Becton Dickinson and Company AOAC-PTM # 090501 25 g - raw ground beef and unpasteurized apple cider N/A EC015b foodproof E. coli O157 Detection Kits (5\'Nuclease and Hybridization Probes) with foodproof ShortPrep II Kit E. coli O157 BIOTECON Diagnostics GmbH AOAC-PTM # 100601 Camembert cheese, egg salad, raw milk, mayonnaise, hamburger meat, brockwurst sausage, coalfish, fresh salmon, apple juice, raw vegetables 25g EC016a GeneDisc E. coli O157:H7 E. coli O157 Pall GeneDisc Technologies AFNOR # GEN 25/06 - 11/08 Raw beef meats (including frozen, seasoned), dairy products and vegetables 25g EC016b GeneDisc Plate Pathogenic E. coli O157 E. coli O157 Pall GeneDisc Technologies AOAC-PTM # 021102 fresh raw ground beef and fresh raw beef trim 25g, 375g EC017 GeneDisc Plate Pathogenic E. coli O157 & Salmonella E. coli O157 & Salmonella spp. Pall GeneDisc Technologies AOAC-PTM # 021104 Fresh raw ground beef, fresh raw beef trim 25g, 375g EC019 Microbiologique E. coli O157, Stx- producing E. coli (STEC) with Intimin and Salmonella Test System E. coli O157, Stx-producing E. coli (STEC, specifically 026, O45, O103, O111, O121 & O145) with intimin & Salmonella IEH Laboratories & Consulting Group AOAC-PTM # 100701 raw ground beef (25 g, 375 g), raw beef trim (25 g, 375 g), raw poultry (25 g), RTE turkey (25 g), mixed leafy greens, (25 g, 125g) 25g except where noted in ""Validated Matrices"" EC020a iQ-Check E. coli O157:H7 Real Time PCR E. coli O157:H7 Bio-Rad Laboratories AOAC-PTM # 020801 Ground beef, apple cider, fresh spinach (25 g), raw ground beef (83% lean), raw beef trim, fresh spinach (375 g), raw chicken breast without skin, raw chicken thigh with skin, mechanically separated chicken, raw ground pork (25 g) 25g except where noted in ""Validated Matrices"" EC020b iQ-Check E. coli O157:H7 Kit E. coli O157 BIO-RAD AFNOR # BRD 07/15 - 06/08 Raw beef 25g EC021b MicroSEQ E. coli O157:H7 Detection Kit E. coli O157:H7 Life Technologies AOAC-PTM # 071001 raw ground beef (25 g, 375 g), raw beef trim (25 g, 375 g); spinach, orange juice, apple juice 25g except where noted in ""Validated Matrices"" EC022b 3M Molecular Detection Assay E. coli O157 (including H7) E. coli O157 3M Health Care AFNOR # 3M 01/12 - 03/13 Raw beef meats, raw dairy products, raw fruits and 25g EC023 PATHATRIX Pooling System for E. coli O157 E. coli O157 (including H7) Life Technologies (Thermo Scientific) AOAC-PTM # 030202 Raw ground beef (25 g) 25g EC024 RapidChek E. coli O157 (including H7) Lateral Flow Test Assay E. coli O157 (including H7) Romer Labs Technology, Inc.

The list is intended to be informational and is not an endorsement or approval of any specific test kit, regardless of its inclusion in the list. FSIS does not specifically endorse any of the mentioned test kits or products and acknowledges that equivalent test kits or products may be available for laboratory use. Likewise, FSIS does not require the use of any specific test kit, including those incorporated into FSIS’s Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook methods. Instead, establishments and laboratories should choose test kits that are: 1)Validated for testing relevant foods by a: a)Recognized independent body (i.e., AOAC, AFNOR, MicroVal, NordVal), b)U.S. regulatory body (i.e., FSIS MLG or FDA BAM), or c) International Organization for Standardization (ISO) process 2)In addition, the validated method should be: a)Fit for the intended purpose and application (e.g., validated for the appropriate matrix and sample size to detect the appropriate foodborne pathogen), and b)Performed per the conditions of the validated protocol by a laboratory that assures the quality of the analytical results. The table below contains a list of foodborne pathogen test kits that are validated by recognized independent organizations (i.e., AOAC, AFNOR, MicroVal, NordVal) and therefore meet criterion 1a above. However, the test kits in this list are not necessarily equivalent or appropriate for all testing applications. FSIS intends to update validated test kit lists on a quarterly basis. # Method Name Target Organism(s) Manufacturer External Validation Validated matrices Validated Test Portion Size STEC001 GeneDisc Plate STEC Shigatoxigenic Escherichia coli Pall GeneDisc Technologies AOAC-PTM # 021103 fresh ground beef (25 g, 375 g), fresh beef trim (25 g, 375 g) See ""Validated Matrices"" STEC003 iQ-Check STEC VirX iQ-Check STEC SerO iQ-Check STEC SerO II Stx1, Stx2, eae, O26, O45, O103, O11, O121, O145, O157:H7, and STEC Bio-Rad Laboratories AOAC-PTM # 121203 raw beef trim, raw ground beef, fresh spinach, beef carcass sampling cloth (4"" x 4"", MicroTally Cloth) 375g STEC004 GeneDisc Plate STEC & Salmonella spp. Shigatoxigenic E. coli and Salmonella spp. Pall GeneDisc Technologies AOAC-PTM # 021105 Fresh raw ground beef, fresh raw beef trim 25g, 375g STEC005 Microbiologique E. coli O157, Stx- producing E. coli (STEC) with Intimin and Salmonella Test System E. coli O157, Stx-producing E. coli (STEC, specifically O26, O45, O103, O111, O121 & O145) with intimin and Salmonella IEH Laboratories & Consulting Group AOAC-PTM # 100701 Raw ground beef (25 g,375 g), raw beef trim (25 g, 375 g), raw poultry (25 g, 375 g), RTE turkey & mixed leafy greens (25g, 125g) 25 g except where noted in ""Validated Matrices"" ** N/A = Not available', '# Method Name Target Organism(s) Manufacturer External Validation Validated matrices Validated Test Portion Size STEC006 BAX System Real-Time PCR Assay Suite for STEC (formerly DuPont BAX System Real-Time PCR Assay Suite for STEC) STEC Screening Assay -stx and eae virulence genes STEC Panel 1 assay -E. coli O26, O111, O121 STEC Panel 2 assay -E. coli O45, O103, O146 Hygiena AOAC-PTM # 091301 raw beef trim (375 g), raw ground beef (325 g, 375 g), raw ground beef plus soy (325 g), raw ground beef (25 g), and all-purpose flour (25 g), dried cannabis flower [>0.3% delta 0-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)] and dried hemp flower (≤0.3% THC) See ""Validated Matrices"" STEC007 Assurance GDS for MPX Top 7 STEC STECs including: O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, O145, & O157 BioControl Systems, Inc.
