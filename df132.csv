text_by_page,"['A Generic HACCP Model for a Raw Intact Farm-raised Catfish Product The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) published the Pathogen Reduction/Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) Systems Final Rule in July 1996. The HACCP regulations (9 CFR Part 417) require establishments to develop and implement a system of controls designed toaddresssafetyhazards reasonably likelyto occur in their production process. Therefore,this HACCPmodel’s focus, and the focus of the other HACCP models,is on product safety, not product quality characteristics. With therule,FSIS made available aguidebook for the preparation of HACCP plans and ageneric model for each food processing category definedinregulation 9 CFR 417.2(b)(1). The guidebookand the generic models have been updated since their initial publication to be consistent with current science and policy. FSIS recommends you use the updated Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans when developing an establishment-specific HACCP plan. Generic models serve as useful examples of how to meet the regulatory requirements. Each model represents a food processingcategory. Each processing category may contain numerous products. Therefore, each single model represents a category of products and, as such, the models do not demonstrate unique products or novel processes. The generic models are not intended to be used as is. FSIS recommends thatestablishmentstailor the model(s) to fit the establishment’s operations. On December 2, 2015, FSIS published the final rule Mandatory Inspection of Fish of the Order Siluriformes and Products Derived from Such Fish (80 FederalRegister75590). The final rule amended the Agency’s regulations to establish a mandatory inspection program for catfish and for products derived fromcatfish.1 The final rule explains that, because catfish are an amenable species under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 601(w)(2)), the catfish inspection program is part of the FSIS meat inspection program.2 Generally, live catfish are processed into whole fish, fillets, steaks, strips,and nuggets. These products are typically sold raw. Raw products may be marinated, vacuum-tumbled, injected, or singleingredient. Catfish fillets are also shipped frozen. Frozen products may contain a preservative (polyphosphate) which is used to minimize excessive water loss during freezing. Polyphosphates are added to the product in a (non-vacuum) tumbler. Little if any U.S. farm-raised catfish undergoes further processing into multi-ingredient ready-to-eat meals (e.g., gumbo, patties, surimi). This model illustrates the raw intact processing offarm-raisedcatfishinto whole fish, fillets, steaks, strips, and nuggets. The model may not necessarily apply to all operations or products. Products or operations mayrequire fewer or more Critical Control Points (CCPs)depending on the operation. The flow diagram demonstrates a general production process and should be modified to reflect the processes used at theestablishment. For additional guidance see the FSIS Compliance Guideline for Establishments that Slaughter or Further Process Siluriformes Fish and Fish Products. The records produced while documenting a HACCP plan, including all documentation used to support the hazard analysis, are HACCP decisionmaking records (9 CFR 417.5(a)). Ensure you maintain the documents producedwhile developing a HACCP plan.3 For further assistance with developing HACCP plans see the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCPPlans and the guidance materials available on the FSIS HACCP webpage. 1For purposes of convenience, the term “catfish” is used in this HACCP model. Other FSISdocuments may use “fish of theorder Siluriformes”, “Siluriformes fish,” or simply “fish” in addition to “catfish”. 2See the Executive Summary of the finalrule Mandatory Inspection of Fish of the Order Siluriformes and Products DerivedFrom Such Fish (page 75590). 3Prior to developing the HACCPplan, please read the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans for detailed descriptionsof the worksheets and hazard analysis. The FSISGuidebook for the Preparation of HACCPPlans and thegeneric HACCPmodels are intended for small and very small establishments seeking assistance in understanding the requirements in Title 9 Code of Federal Regulations (9 CFR)Part417. The HACCP model is for demonstration purposes only. The model does not represent requirements thatmustbe met. Establishments are required to develop HACCPplans specificto their facilities, production practices, and products.

Justification or Basis for Decision14 If yes in Column 2 (hazard RLTO), What Control Measures Can Be Applied to Prevent, Eliminate, or Reduce the Hazard to Acceptable Levels15 Is this Step a Critical Control Point (CCP)? 1. Receiving Farm-raised Catfish B: Salmonella No A hazard identification study identified Salmonella as one of the few potential hazards. There is evidence that at least one outbreak of human salmonellosis may have been related to catfish consumption. Although Salmonella has been isolated from farm-raised catfish fillets, Salmonella contamination is a hazard not reasonably likely to occur when processing catfish. Product is to be fully cooked prior to consumption. 13Hazards are grouped into three categories:Biological (B), Chemical (C), and Physical (P). Biological hazardsarelivingorganisms. Chemical hazardsmaybe naturally occurringin foods, used or added during the processingoffoods, or administered to live animals. Physicalhazards are acomponent of afood that is unexpected, such as plastic, glass, metal, or bone in a boneless product. See the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCPPlans for more information about hazards identification. 14Scientific references are important in making decisions, providing justifications, and validating the HACCPsystem. When scientific references are used for decisions, the referenced articles mustbe part ofthe HACCP records. If the scientific justification is from FSIS, then list thedocument name. If justification is not from an FSIS program, then HACCP system design must be supported by documentary evidence –thatis, the theoretical principles, expert advice from processing authorities, scientific ortechnical data, peer-reviewed journal articles, pathogen modeling programs, or other information demonstrating that particular process control measures can adequately prevent, reduce, or eliminate specific hazards. These non-FSIS supporting documents must bekept for the lifeof theHACCP plan. 15Because the results obtained under prerequisite programs could affect decisions made in the hazard analysis, an establishmentis required to maintain records associated with these programs as supporting documentation for its hazard analysis (9 CFR 417.5(a)). When an establishment determines thata potential hazard is not reasonably likely to occur because the implementation of a prerequisite program (e.g., Sanitation SOP, written sanitary dressing proceduresincorporated into prerequisite programs, purchase specifications, or antimicrobial interventions) prevents conditions that make the potential hazard likely, that prerequisite program thenbecomes partof the HACCP system andas a result, must be validated. Thismeansthat establishmentsmustmaintainscientific or technical support for the design of those prerequisite programs used to support decisions in the hazard analysisand must collect in-plant validation data to support that the programs are implemented as designed (see FSIS Compliance Guideline HACCP Systems Validation, page 5).

The list contains the allowable amounts and the intended use of the approved antimicrobials. The list (Directive 7120.1) can be used as supporting documentation for chemical hazard controls (safety and suitability). Directive 7120.1 cannot be used as support for the control of biologicalhazards because the antimicrobial concentration needed to control bacteria is different from the concentrations required for safety and suitability. 19Note:this “historical data” must be supported with evidence from the establishment through the establishment’s history or validation data with reference to the actual SOP or prerequisite program.

These controls should be evident within the written document upon review.

However, if an establishment implements different critical operational parameters in the process from the scientific support, or the scientific support identified does not contain microbiological data, then the establishment should collect in-plant data demonstrating the critical operational parameters that it has implemented can all be met AND should collect in-plant microbiological data or identify scientific support with microbiological data that demonstrates the effectiveness of those implemented critical operational parameter (FSIS Compliance Guideline HACCP Systems Validation, page 27).
