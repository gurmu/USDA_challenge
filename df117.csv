The HACCP regulations (9 CFR Part 417) require establishments to develop and implement a system of controls designed to address safety hazards reasonably likely to occur in their production process. Therefore, this HACCP model’s focus, and the focus of the other HACCP models, is on product safety, not product quality characteristics. With the rule, FSIS made available a Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans and a generic model for each food processing category defined in the regulation (9 CFR 417.2(b)(1)). The guidebook and the generic models have been updated since their initial publication to be consistent with current science and policy. FSIS recommends you use of the updated Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans when developing an establishment-specific HACCP plan. Generic models serve as useful examples of how to meet the regulatory requirements. Each model represents a food processing category. Each processing category may contain numerous products. Therefore, each single model represents a category of products and, as such, the models do not demonstrate unique products or novel processes. The generic models are not intended to be used “as is”. FSIS recommends that establishments tailor the model(s) to fit the establishment’s operation. The model’s critical control points (CCPs) do not necessarily apply to all operations or products in the product category. Products or operations may require fewer or more CCPs depending on the operation. The flow diagram demonstrates a general production process and should be modified to reflect the processes used at the establishment. The food safety critical limits selected must come from scientific documents or other reliable sources to meet regulatory validation requirements. Each model includes references for guidance on the selection of critical limits. The records produced while documenting a HACCP plan, including all documentation used to support the hazard analysis, are HACCP records ((CFR 417.5(a)). The selection of processing categories and HACCP models are preliminary steps to completing a hazard analysis. The documents produced during the selection process are HACCP records. Ensure you maintain the documents produced while developing a HACCP plan. For further assistance with developing HACCP plans see the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans and the guidance materials available on the FSIS HACCP webpage.', 'Page 2 of 15 EXAMPLE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION1 PROCESS / PRODUCT NAME: Beef Jerky (Ready-to-Eat, Heat-Treated, Shelf-Stable) Process / Product Name Beef Jerky (Ready-to-Eat, Heat-Treated, Shelf-Stable) Important Product Characteristics2 (water activity, pH, Preservatives, etc.) Contains Sodium Nitrite and Sodium Erythorbate Water activity < 0.85 Intended Use Ready-to-eat3 Packaging (Durability and storage conditions) Plastic vacuumed packed single-serve units and stored at ambient temperature Shelf Life and at what temperature 240 days unopened and not refrigerated Where it will be sold (specify intended consumers, especially at-risk populations4) Sold to household consumers through retail outlets or distributed to hotels, restaurants, and institutions (HRI).

What special distribution controls are required? None DATE: ________________ APPROVED BY: 1 Prior to developing the HACCP plan please read the FSIS Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans for detailed descriptions of the worksheets and hazard analysis. The FSIS Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans and the generic HACCP models are intended for small and very small establishments seeking assistance in understanding the requirements in Title 9 Code of Federal Regulations (9 CFR) Part 417. The HACCP models are for demonstration purposes only. The models do not represent requirements that must be met. Establishments are required to develop HACCP plans specific to their facilities, production practices, and products. 2 This jerky example is a product cured with sodium nitrite. See the Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book for jerky standards. Examples of jerky standards are products that have a moisture to protein ratio of 0.75:1 or less, they may be cured or uncured, and sodium nitrite is not required. Establishments should gather documentation to support the moisture to protein ratio standard using inplant data collected during initial validation and on-going verification. 3 The intended use or consumer of the product must be identified in accordance with 9 CFR 417.2(a)(2). Identifying the product’s intended use in the product description is one way to meet the regulatory requirements specific to 417.2(a)(2). 3 At-risk populations include young children, the elderly and immunocompromised persons.', 'Page 3 of 15 EXAMPLE LIST OF PRODUCT INGREDIENTS AND INCOMING MATERIAL5 Process / Product Name: Beef Jerky (Ready-to-Eat, Heat-Treated, Shelf-Stable) Meat and Meat by-products Boneless beef top rounds and top sirloins Non-Meat food ingredients Sugar, Salt, Soy Sauce (water, wheat, soybeans, salt, sodium benzoate, brewing starter (Aspergillus Sojae)), Flavor and Spice Mixture Antimicrobials6 and processing aids None Packaging material Plastic vacuum bags Restricted ingredients and allergens Sodium Nitrite, Sodium Erythorbate, Soy Sauce (soy and wheat) Other None DATE: ______________ APPROVED BY: 4 List all meat, non-meat ingredients, restricted ingredients (for example, nitrites), processing aids, packaging material used in production of this product. This is important to help identify any special ingredients or processes to address in the HACCP plan.

To review restrictions on the use of nitrite and sodium ascorbate or sodium erythorbate, see 9 CFR 424.22(b). 6 FSIS and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that establishes the working relationship followed when responding to notifications for the use of food additives (including ingredients) intended for use in the production of FSIS regulated products. FSIS determines the suitability of the use of food ingredients used in the production of meat, poultry, and egg products. FSIS consults, as necessary, with FDA on the requirements under the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations. See FSIS Directive 7120.1, Safe and Suitable Ingredients Used in Meat Poultry and Egg Products for the list of suitable ingredients.', 'Page 4 of 15 EXAMPLE PROCESS FLOW DIAGRAM7 Process / Product Name: Beef Jerky (Ready-to-Eat, Heat-Treated, Shelf-Stable)8 11. Returned Product9 6 This is an example flow diagram. Establishments’ flow diagrams for the same product may be different. Establishments determine which steps are included in their process. The steps must represent all relevant hazards in the hazard analysis. 7 For more information on general processing steps used in jerky production see the FSIS Compliance Guideline for Meat and Poultry Jerky Produced by Small and Very Small Establishments. As discussed on pages 6-7, antimicrobial interventions may also be added before, during, or after marinating the strips of raw beef to increase the level of pathogen reduction beyond that achieved by cooking alone. 9 The Returned Product step (12) is shown as not connected to another process step.

Biological hazards are living organisms. Chemical hazards may be naturally occurring in foods, used, or added during the processing of foods, or administered to live animals. Physical hazards are a component of a food that is unexpected, such as plastic, glass, metal, or bone in a boneless product. See the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans for more information about hazards identification. 12 Place the justification for your decision in column 4. Include control measures in column 4 for hazards not reasonably likely to occur and place them in column 5 for hazards reasonably likely to occur. If a hazard is reasonable likely to occur, then a CCP must be addressed at this step or a later step. See FSIS Meat and Poultry Hazards and Controls Guide for a list of frequently used controls. 13 Scientific references are important in making decisions, providing justifications, and validating the HACCP system. When scientific references are used for decisions, the referenced article must be part of the HACCP records. If the scientific justification is from FSIS, then list the document name. If justification is not from an FSIS program, then HACCP system design must be supported by documentary evidence – that is, the theoretical principles, expert advice from processing authorities, scientific or technical data, peerreviewed journal articles, pathogen modeling programs, or other information demonstrating that particular process control measures can adequately prevent, reduce, or eliminate specific hazards. These non-FSIS supporting documents must be kept for the life of the HACCP plan. 14 Because the results obtained under prerequisite programs could affect decisions made in the hazard analysis, an establishment is required to maintain records associated with these programs as supporting documentation for its hazard analysis (9 CFR 417.5(a)). When an establishment determines that a potential hazard is not reasonably likely to occur because the implementation of a prerequisite program (e.g., Sanitation SOP, written sanitary dressing procedures incorporated into prerequisite programs, purchase specifications, antimicrobial interventions) prevents conditions that make the potential hazard likely, that prerequisite program then becomes part of the HACCP system and as a result, must be validated. This means that establishments must maintain scientific or technical support for the design of those prerequisite programs used to support decisions in the hazard analysis and must collect in-plant validation data to support that the programs are implemented as designed (see FSIS Compliance Guideline HACCP Systems Validation, page 5). 15 Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) includes serogroups O157:H7, O26, O45, O103, O111, O121 and O145).

When historical data is not available (for example, a HACCP plan for a new process or product), then system design must be supported by other documentary evidence. Such as the FSIS Meat and Poultry Hazards and Controls Guide which states “Appropriate screening procedure for monitoring equipment or product such as metal detector, screens or X-ray detector” are frequently used controls for foreign material hazards in processing. 19 This Foreign Material SOP (prerequisite program) should have details on how this procedure is preventing the hazard from occurring (such as metal prevention controls) as well as the on-going verification procedures. These controls should be evident within the written document upon review.

However, if an establishment implements different critical operational parameters in the process from the scientific support, or the scientific support identified does not contain microbiological data, then the establishment should collect in-plant data demonstrating the critical operational parameters that it has implemented can all be met AND should collect in-plant microbiological validation data or identify scientific support with microbiological data that demonstrates the effectiveness of those implemented critical operational parameters (FSIS Compliance Guideline HACCP Systems Validation, page 27). 24 See FSIS Compliance Guideline for Meat and Poultry Jerky Produced by Small and Very Small Establishments for more detailed information and for scientific support.
