text_by_page,"['Food Safety And Inspection Service Office of Policy, Program and Employee Development August 2005 Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book Revised for Web Publication August 2005 Replaces Publication Dated May 2003 and Removal of Publication Dated 1996', 'PREFACE The Policy Book is intended to be guidance to help manufacturers and prepare product labels that are truthful and not misleading. Compliance with the requirements set forth in this publication does not, in itself, guarantee an authorization. On receipt of the label application, consideration will be given to suitability of ingredients statements, preparation, and packaging so as not to mislead the consumer. Adherence to the product and label requirements in this Policy Book does not necessarily guarantee against possible infringement of all related patents, trademarks or copyrights. Changes in this publication are to add new entries, correct errors, condense material, and reformat the entries for ease in reading and use. There will be updates of the publication to conform to changes in meat and poultry inspection standards and to reflect any current policy developments. Errors found in this issue should be reported through channels to your district office.', 'INTRODUCTION This Policy Book is assembled in dictionary form and may be used in conjunction with the Meat and Poultry Inspection Regulations and the Meat and Poultry Inspection Manual, Directives and Notices. It is a composite of policy and day-to-day labeling decision, many of which do not appear in the above publications. They are subject to change and therefore a periodic updating of this book will take place. Note: Red Meat Required percentages of meat required for red meat products are shown on the basis of fresh uncooked weight unless otherwise indicated. For purposes of this Policy Book, whenever the terms beef, pork, lamb, mutton, or veal are used they indicate the use of skeletal muscle tissue from the named species (9 CFR 301.2). Note: Poultry Required percentages for poultry products are based on a cooked deboned basis unless otherwise stated. When the standards indicate “poultry”, the skin and fat are not to exceed natural proportions per (9 CFR 381.117(d)). Applications for label approval should be addressed as follows: USDA, FSIS, OPPED Labeling and Consumer Protection Staff (LCPS) 1400 Independence Avenue, SW Room 614 – Annex Building Washington, DC 20250-3700 Product samples (only when requested by LCPS) should be packed with sufficient refrigerant to last until received. Shipping should be coordinated with requestor to assure delivery before 4:00 p.m. Friday.

AGED: Aging is the process by which fresh beef (carcasses or cuts) are held in a controlled environment for a specified period of time of slaughter, to allow enzymatic activity t degrade complex proteins and promote the development of flavor and tenderness. The term “Aged” on a label must be qualified, e.g., “Aged 65 days.” See: Dry Aged AGED BEEF: The beef products (carcass or cuts) are maintained in a fresh unfrozen state for a minimum of 14 days from the day of slaughter. Aging claims made within the supply chain (e.g., prior to the point of sale at retail or food service) shall specify the minimum number of days aged and the type of aging used on the principal display panel on the label (e.g., “Wet aged for a minimum of days.”). If an aging claim is made at the point of sale to the consumer, the minimum claimed for aging shall appear on the principal display panel of the label (e.g., “Aged for a minimum of a minimum of days.”). For additional information refer to USDA, AMS, Standardization Branch “ALL”, “PURE”, AND “100 PERCENT” POULTRY: A labeling claim, such as, “meat used is 100 percent white meat”, may only be used when the poultry meat contains no added ingredients. A labeling claim, such as, “white meat only,” is acceptable when white meat is used to the exclusion of dark meat. In this situation, other ingredients may be present in the poultry portion of the product.', '“ALL or 100 PERCENT BEEF (Patty Mix)”: Beef patty mix may be labeled “all,” “pure,” or “100 percent beef,” when the only added ingredients are partially defatted chopped beef or finely textured beef. An ingredients statement would be required on bulk packed product but not retail packages. “All,” “Pure,” or “100 percent,” may not be used if partially defatted beef fatty tissue (PDBFT), is used or mechanically separated species (MSS), are used. ALPHA CELLULOSE: When used as a carrier of flavoring ingredients, it need not be shown in the ingredients statement, unless it functions as a binder in the meat or poultry product. AMENABILITY: The Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) and Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA), and their implementing regulations, provide for certain exemptions from USDA jurisdiction (and, therefore, inspection), e.g., products prepared for human consumption that contain meat or poultry ingredients in relatively small proportions, or are not considered by consumers to be products of the meat or poultry industry. Generally, the USDA has determined by policy that the “relatively small proportions” of livestock ingredients are: 3 percent or less raw meat; less than 2 percent cooked meat or other portions of the carcass; or 30 percent or less fat, tallow or meat extract, alone or in combination. In the case of poultry, the “relatively small proportions” are: less than 2 percent cooked poultry meat; less than 10 percent cooked poultry skins, giblets or fat, separately; or less than 10 percent cooked poultry skins, giblets, fat and poultry meat (limited to less than 2 percent) in any combination (refer to 9 CFR Part 381.15(a)). For dried products containing poultry, these percentages are computed on the basis of the moist cooked chicken in the ready to serve product when prepared according to the directions on the consumer package. Regarding the second exemption criterion, the USDA has determined the application of the “historical perception” criterion to food products containing meat or poultry on a case-by-case basis. Some products that are exempted from USDA jurisdiction based on the criteria above include stocks or broths prepared with “relatively small amounts” of meat or poultry, bouillon cubes, dehydrated meat soups, cheese balls with pepperoni, pork and beans, closed-face sandwiches, mince meat, bagel dogs, and pepperoni rolls. A condition for the application of these exemptions is that product exempt from USDA jurisdiction must still be prepared with USDA inspected meat or poultry product or meat or poultry from an inspection system equivalent to the USDA inspection system. In addition, generally, any product exempted from USDA jurisdiction cannot be represented as a meat food or poultry product, except as provided in the meat or poultry regulations. A product is deemed as representing a meat food or poultry product if a term representing meat or poultry is used on labeling, e.g., in the product name, without appropriate qualification.', 'ANDOUILLE (FR): Made with pork and/or pork byproducts stuffed into large intestines. Product can be sold cooked or uncooked. Andouille is a coined name and must be accompanied by a true product name, e.g., “sausage” or “pudding” depending on formulation. If beef is used, it must be shown in the product name, e.g., “Beef Andouille Sausage” or “Beef Andouille Pudding.” ANTIOXIDANTS: BHA and BHT are permitted in spice mixtures at 0.02 percent of the essential oil content without declaration on meat or poultry food product labels. Antioxidants are permitted in cooked fresh sausages and fresh sausage-like products (e.g., a pork, water soy protein product). BHA and BHT are not permitted in non-specific meat or poultry products. APPROXIMATE: The word “approximate” may be used to describe the thickness of bacon and the number of pieces in an institutional package when the actual net weight is declared (for example, 18 21 pieces). “Approximately” is acceptable in a descriptive designation for meat and poultry products (for example, “Containing approximately 6% of a solution of...” or “Marinated with approximately 3% solution of...”). The word “approximate” cannot be used in conjunction with the serving size or the required declaration of net weight of contents. ARROZ CON POLLO (SP): The product must contain at least 15 percent cooked chicken meat. The label must show, the true product name, in English, i.e., “Rice with Chicken,” except if the product is distributed solely in Puerto Rico. ARTIFICIAL MARBLING -RED MEAT PRODUCTS: Fats and oils, for example, butter, margarine, vegetable oils. etc., may be added to red meat products, for example, roast beef and steaks. However, the presence of such substances must be indicated as part of the product name, as a product name qualifier, or in a solution statement, for example, “Roast Beef and Margarine Product,” “Vegetable Oil Added,” “Containing 10% of a solution of milk,...” All applicable regulations and policies should be followed for these products. In addition, products that appear to be of a higher quality must include a statement to indicate this, for example, “Injected with Beef Fat” or “Product may appear to be of a higher quality than the actual grade.” Samples may be necessary to determine if this requirement applies.', 'ARTIFICIALLY COLORED PRODUCTS: Labels of products which are artificially colored either by artificial colors or natural colors must bear a statement to indicate the presence of the coloring, e.g., “artificially colored” or “colored with annatto.” Products whose true color is disguised by packing media, e.g., colored pickling solutions, must also have labels that include a statement that indicates the presence of the color. The statement must appear in a prominent and conspicuous manner contiguous to the product name. When a component within a product is artificially colored, e.g., breading, sauce, and sausage, a qualifying statement is not necessary. However, in all cases, the presence of the coloring must appear in the ingredients statement. Whenever FD&C Yellow No. 5 is used, it must be declared in the ingredients statement by FD&C Yellow No. 5 or Yellow 5. Some products, e.g., chorizos and some of the sausages of the longaniza variety, are expected to be characterized by coloring. In these situations, the presence of the coloring need only be indicated in the ingredients statement. See: Policy Memo 112 on caramel coloring Policy Memo 095 on colored casings Policy Memo 113 dated June 24, 1988 AU GRATIN POTATOES AND BACON: At least 8 percent fully cooked bacon (based on 40 percent yield). BABY FOOD: High Meat Dinner -At least 26 percent meat. High Meat Poultry Dinner -At least 18.75 percent cooked poultry meat, skin, fat and giblets. Meat and Broth -At least 61 percent meat. Vegetable with Meat -At least 8 percent meat. Poultry with Broth -At least 43 percent cooked poultry meat, skin, and giblets. Poultry and Rice -At least 5 percent cooked deboned poultry meat. Note: Wine, Mechanically Separated Species, nitrites, and nitrates are not acceptable in baby and toddler foods. BABY FOOD WITH FRESH HAM OR BACON: Ham or bacon without nitrates or nitrites must be shown in the ingredients statement as ham or bacon (water, salt, sugar, etc., without nitrates or nitrites).', 'BACON: The term “bacon” is used to describe the cured belly of a swine carcass. If meat from other portions of the carcass is used, the product name must be qualified to identify the portions, e.g., “Pork Shoulder Bacon.” “Certified” refers to products that have been treated for trichinae. See: 9 CFR 318.10 BACON AND PORK SAUSAGE: Product is formulated with a high percentage of bacon (usually bacon ends and pieces) with at least 20 percent pork. BACON ARKANSAS AND ARKANSAS STYLE BACON: Product which is identified as Arkansas Bacon or Arkansas Style Bacon is produced from the pork shoulder blade Boston roast. The pork shoulder blade Boston roast includes the porcine muscle, fat and bone, cut interior of the second or third thoracic vertebrae, and posterior of the atlas joint (first cervical vertebrae), and dorsal of the center of the humerus bone. For Arkansas Bacon, the neck bones and rib bones are removed by cutting close to the underside of those bones. The blade bone (scapula) and the dorsal fat covering, including the skin (clear plate), are removed, leaving no more than one-quarter inch of the fat covering the roast. The meat is then dry cured with salt, sugar, nitrites, and spices, and smoked with natural smoke. The meat may not be injected or soaked in curing brine, nor may any artificial or liquid smoke be applied to the meat. Product that is prepared outside the state of Arkansas but in the manner prescribed may be identified as “Arkansas Style Bacon.” The true product name must be shown as “Boneless Cured Pork Shoulder Butt.” BACON (Canned -Pasteurized): A shelf stable item, which must have at least 7 percent brine concentration. BACON (Canned, Prefried): In “Canned Prefried Bacon,” e.g., “Bacon Crumbles,” the following criteria should be applied: 1. M/SP Index of 0.4 or more. M/SP = Moisture/ (Salt x Protein) 2. A Brine Ratio of 9.0 or less. Brine Ratio = Moisture/Salt', '3. A Brine concentration of 10 percent or more. Brine concentration = Salt/(Moisture + Salt) 4. Maximum 40 percent yield BACON (Cooked): Not to yield more than 40 percent bacon -60 percent shrink required. BHA and BHT may be used as antioxidants in precooked bacon at level of 0.01 percent individually or 0.02 percent collectively, based on fat content. TBHQ can be used in products as an antioxidant in combination with BHT and BHA; but it can not be used alone except in cooked bacon. BACON DRESSING FOR STUFFING: The product must contain at least 8 percent bacon. BACON-LIKE PRODUCTS: Bacon-like products, including poultry bacon, labeled with “bacon” in the name must follow the same requirements as those applied to pork bacon. These requirements include, but are not limited to, limits on restricted ingredients and the requirement that the bacon must return to green weight. Beef bacon is a cured and smoked beef product sliced to simulate regular bacon. It is prepared from various beef cuts and offered with a variety of coined names, including “Breakfast Beef,” “Beef Bacon,” etc. A common or usual name is required, e.g., “Cured and Smoked Beef Plate,” and should be shown contiguous to the coined name. Poultry bacon products are acceptable and may be designated as (Kind) Bacon. However, a true descriptive name must appear contiguous to (Kind) Bacon without intervening type or design, in letters at least one-half the size of the letters used in the (Kind) Bacon, and in the same style and color and on the same background. An example of an acceptable designation is “Turkey Bacon-Cured Turkey Breast Meat-Chopped and Formed.” The descriptive name can serve alone as the product name. See: Policy Memo 106A dated December 17, 1991 BACON PRODUCTS: The bacon products intended for further cooking before consumption, i.e., slab bacon for deli slicing, can be labeled “certified,” “roasted” or “partially cooked” provided the product is cooked to 148° F and the labeling clearly indicated the product is intended to be further cooked before consumption.', 'BANGERS: A sausage-like product prepared with meat and varying amounts of rusk or other cereals. The label must show percentage of rusk (or other cereal) adjacent to product name in prominent lettering. May be labeled British, Scottish or Irish Style. BARBECUE (BBQ), PRODUCTS: Barbecue (BBQ), products that are composed of uncured red meat products that are injected, massaged, tumbled, etc., and which are cooked back to or below the weight of the raw meat product (green weight), must use the term “seasoned” or “flavored,” in conjunction with the meat product in the product name, e.g., “BBQ Seasoned Pork,” or “Sliced Seasoned Beef with Barbecue Sauce.” The labeling for uncured red meat products containing some solutions that are used to make BBQ products (9 CFR 319.312 or 319.80) which are not cooked back to green weight or are not in compliance with the cooking yield must have a containing statement on the label. A containing statement is required in the product name when the cooking yield is not met, e.g., “BBQ Pork Containing up to 15 percent of a solution.” Similarly, a containing statement is required in the product name when the product does not have sufficient quantities of meat minus the solution to meet the minimum meat requirement. However, in limited situations when the minimum meat requirement (minus the solution) is met and when cook yield is compensated for by adding additional meat, the containing statement can either be placed in the product name or attached to the meat component in the ingredients statement, e.g., “Ingredients: Beef Containing up to 25 percent …sugar, spices.” Also, see Policy Memo 84A and Policy Memo 102. Red meat components that contain binders and extenders and do not meet one of the barbecue standards (9 CFR 319.80, 319.312) shall be descriptively labeled to include the extender, nomenclature in the product name, e.g., “BBQ Seasoned Beef, Modified Food Starch and Gelatinized Wheat Starch”, “Pork and Binder Product with Barbecue Sauce”, or “BBQ Cooked Beef and Binder Product” followed by a parenthetical list of all of its ingredients. Bone-in red meat products do not have to comply with Federal meat regulation, 9 CFR 319.312 or 319.80 with regard to cooking yield and must indicate the presence of bones in product name, e.g., “Seasoned Cooked Pork Ribs with Barbecue Sauce” or “Barbecue Beef Ribs.” When bone-in red meat products are injected, massaged, tumbled, etc., and do not return to green weight after cooking, the containing statement shall appear once on the label in (1) the ingredients statement as part of the red meat component (only if there is enough Beef Ribs without solution to meet the requirement for “Beef Ribs and BBQ Sauce”), or (2) in the product name, e.g., “Beef Ribs, containing 10 percent of a solution and BBQ Sauce.”', 'BARBECUE (Infrared Cooked): The label must indicate heat source, e.g., “infrared cooked,” with lettering no less than one-half the size of the largest letter in the word “barbecue.” BARBECUE MEAT OR POULTRY “EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA STYLE”: Acceptable identification for barbecued meat (9 CFR 319.80) or barbecued poultry (9 CFR 381.164 or 381.165) product that is flavored with a vinegar based solution using apple cider vinegar or white vinegar. The solution is seasoned with pepper, that is, black pepper, red pepper, or cayenne pepper. Other ingredients may include salt, sugar and hot pepper sauce. BARBECUE SAUCE WITH CHICKEN: The product must contain at least 15 percent cooked chicken meat. Changing the size of the term “Chicken” does not change the 15 percent cooked chicken meat requirement. BARBECUE SAUCE WITH MEAT: The product must contain at least 35 percent cooked meat. When the name of the product shows meat in smaller letters, not more than one-half the size of the largest letter in the product name, 25 percent cooked meat is required.

Total product should not contain more than 50 percent cooked noodles. BEEF CHEEK MEAT AND BEEF HEAD MEAT AND PORK CHEEK MEAT AND PORK HEAD MEAT (USE AND LABELING AS AN INGREDIENT IN MEAT FOOD PRODUCTS): Beef cheek meat and pork cheek meat refers to beef and pork cheeks from which the glandular material has been removed. Beef head meat and pork head meat refer to muscle tissue remaining on the beef and hog skull after removal of the skin, cheeks, tongue, and lips. The meat normally attached to and considered as part of the tongue trimmings when detached from the tongue trimmings may also be included as beef head meat or pork head meat although it can be labeled as “beef” or “pork.” When beef cheek meat and/or beef head meat are included in boneless beef, its presence must be specifically declared. Examples include: “Boneless Beef -Contains Beef Cheek Meat and Beef Head Meat,” “Boneless Beef Head Meat,” “Boneless Beef -Ingredients:', 'Beef, Beef Head Meat, Beef Cheek Meat,” or “Boneless Beef -20 percent Beef Head Meat, 15 percent Beef Cheek Meat.” Beef cheek meat and/or beef head meat may be used in unlimited quantities and identified as “beef” in meat food products unless restricted by regulatory standards for specific products as indicated in 9 CFR 319.15(a) (Chopped beef, ground beef), 319.15(b) (Hamburger), 319.15(d) (Fabricated steak), 319.81 (Roast Beef parboiled and steam roasted), 319.100 (Corned beef), 319.300 (Chili con carne), 319.301 (Chili con carne with beans), and 319.303 (Corned beef hash). The presence of pork head meat is not required to be identified on the labeling of boneless pork. However, pork cheek meat and/or pork head meat may be used in unlimited quantities and identified as “pork” in meat food products, unless restricted by regulatory standards as indicated in 9 CFR 319.300 (Chili con carne) and 319.301 (Chili con carne with beans). See: Policy Memo 098B dated August 1, 1990 -Cheek Meat BEEF CONCENTRATE AND SALT: Broth derived from cooking fresh beef containing 3 percent to 4 percent solids is centrifuged and evaporated to approximately 60 percent solids under vacuum. The water fraction is salted to a level of 25.5 percent of the water weight (100 lbs. concentrated stock at 60 percent will have 10.2 lbs. of salt added, making a total weight of 110.2 lbs.). There is no need for refrigeration. BEEF CONSOMME: The standard requires beef as an ingredient and a minimum protein content of at least 3 percent in the finished product. “Beef stock” or “beef broth” (or mixture of both) may be used to comprise the beef ingredient. Additional optional ingredients are gelatin, beef extract, tomato puree, hydrolyzed plant protein, and seasoning. BEEF (Dried or Air Dried): Product name is “Air Dried Beef” or “Dried Beef.” MPR 2.04:1. It is usually cured by rub and/or stitch pump followed by cover pickle for 4 to 8 weeks with several overhauls (turned over for the application of additional cure), then placed in smokehouse or drying chambers for 3 to 10 days. BEEF FIBRIN: This is a component mixture of beef fibrinogen and beef thrombin plasma protein used to bind pieces of meat or poultry together. It is limited to 10 percent.', '1. If used from seven percent of ten percent, it must appear in the product name, e.g., “Bacon Wrapped Beef Tenderloin Steak Formed with Beef Fibrinogen and Thrombin.” Therefore, the smallest letter in the product name must be at least 1/3 size of the smallest letter in the product name. 2. If used at less than seven percent, it must be a product name qualifier, e.g., “Formed with Beef Fibrinogen and Thrombin.” As a product name qualifier, there is no size requirement, however, it must contiguous to the product name and be prominent and conspicuous. Additionally, the terms “Beef Fibrin” or “Fibrin” may be used in the product name as a qualifier and its components identified elsewhere on the principal display panel. In this situation, the terms “Beef Fibrin” or “Fibrin” and its components are linked to each other by means of asterisks. Acceptable terminology’s for the components are “Beef Fibrinogen and Thrombin Plasma Protein,” or “Beef Fibrinogen and Thrombin.” BEEF GRAVY MIX: The product must contain at least 15 percent dried beef. BEEF MARSALA: The product must contain at least 50 percent beef. Product contains beef cubes, Marsala wine sauce, and usually mushrooms and onions.

BEEF SUKIYAKI: The product must contain at least 30 percent meat based on total product. Consists of thinly sliced beef and various vegetables cooked in a flavored beef stock. This is not a stew as the vegetables and components are mixed during the cooking process. Vegetables used with this food are celery, bean sprouts, leeks, onions, mushrooms, Chinese cabbage, carrots, spinach, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, and bean curds. BEEF TRIPE STEW: There are two versions of this product. One is of Mexican origin and merchandised in association with the term “Menudo.” Corn is a prominent ingredient in its formula. The standard for an item of this nature requires that it contain not less than 33 percent beef tripe computed on the basis of the uncooked tripe in relation to total ingredients. The second product is popular in Puerto Rico. It is referred to as “Mondungo.” The product is made with 25 percent raw beef tripe. The remainder consists principally of potatoes, a squash with pumpkin-like appearance and flavor, and a native vegetable called “Tanier.” When the vegetables are not distinguishable, this product can be labeled as “Dominican Style Mondungo.” BEEF WELLINGTON: It is made with beef tenderloin that is roasted very rare. It is then spread with a liver pate, covered with pastry, and baked in a hot oven until pastry is brown. The product must contain at least 50 percent cooked meat and no more than 30 percent pastry.

Same requirements as beef salami, with the exception that pork may be used.', 'BERLINER: A cooked smoked sausage usually made from coarsely cut cured pork in large casings. When beef is used, it shall not exceed 50 percent of the meat block. Pork stomachs or beef tripe not permitted. See: Policy Memo 048 dated May 18, 1982 BERLINER BLOOD SAUSAGE: A cooked blood sausage containing diced bacon. After cooking it is dried and smoked. Ham fat, snouts, and lips are not permitted. See: Blood Sausage BIER SCHINKEN (GR): The literal translation is “Beer Ham.” If product is made of all pork, it may be labeled “Bier Schinken.” BINDERS IN POULTRY, BONELESS, RAW OR COOKED: Binding agents may be added individually or collectively in amounts not to exceed 3 percent for cooked poultry products and 2 percent for raw poultry products based on total finished product. When binders are added in excess of these levels, the common or usual name of the binder or the generic term “Binders Added” shall be included in a product name qualifier, e.g., “Turkey Breast-Gelatin Added.” In all cases, the presence of these ingredients must be shown in the ingredients statement. This policy is intended to apply to binders which are used in chopped or chunked poultry products that are formed into rolls, loaves, etc., but not to binders added directly into whole muscle by injection, massaging, tumbling, etc., which then act as extenders. See: Policy Memo 103 dated February 13, 1987 BLOCKWURST: A semi-dry type sausage. The maximum MPR is 3.7:1. BLOOD AND TONGUE SAUSAGE: Same as blood sausage, except cured and cooked pork or beef tongues are used.', 'BLOOD SAUSAGE: A cooked sausage formulated with blood and some meat.

BONE-IN MEAT WITH SAUCE: Must have at least 50 percent meat (cooked basis). Product with barbecue sauce must comply with 9 CFR 319.312. BONELESS BREAST TRIMMINGS: Boneless breast trimmings (turkey or chicken) are defined as trimmings that are removed from the breast portion only. When a product is formulated with boneless breast trimmings, the amount of skin should be indicated in order to determine that the meat requirement is met for a standardized product and that the product is properly labeled.

Some substances, e.g., maltodextrin and modified food starch, are not carriers but actually diluents or bulking agents, and must be declared in the ingredients statement. Dextrose and/or sugar are commonly used as carriers for spice extracts and resins of spices. The carrier must be declared in the ingredients statement, except in those cases where a sweetening agent is used separately in formulating the meat or poultry product and the use of the spice mixture will not result in the quantity of the carrier being more than 0.75 percent of the seasoning mix.

When a cheese product and meat or poultry food product are packaged together, the product name shown on the label must show the name of each component product. For example, if slices of ham and slices of a cheese product are packaged together, the product name should include “Ham” and the name of the cheese product (e.g., Ham and Pasteurized Processed American Cheese). Alternatively, the Pasteurized Processed American Cheese could be parenthetically qualified contiguous to the product name (e.g., “Ham and Cheese (Pasteurized Processed American Cheese”). The name “Ham and Cheese” alone would be acceptable if the cheese used was “Cheddar Cheese.” 5. Use of substitute or imitation cheese in products where real cheese is expected (e.g., Cordon Bleu) requires the product name be changed or qualified to indicate the presence of the ersatz cheese. Substitute and imitation cheeses cannot be described as “cheese” in the product name. There is no limitation on the amount of ersatz cheese used. 6.

Acceptable product names include: “Cooked Corned Beef and X % Water” or “Cooked Cured Pork and Water Product, X % of Weight is Added Ingredients,” and “Cooked Pastrami and Up to 20 % of a Solution.” The ingredients of the solution may accompany the product name or appear in locations prescribed for ingredient statements. Product name prominence guidelines are found in Policy Memo 087A (on Word Size in Labeling of Product Names and Fanciful Names) and Policy Memo 109 (on Labeling Prominence Guidelines for Cured, Cooked Products with Added Substances That Do Not Return to Green Weight). If product name qualifiers, such as “X % of Weight is Added Ingredients,” are used, the labeling prominence guidelines used for cured pork products as found in 9 CFR 319.104(b) apply.', 'Uncured red meat products that weigh more than the weight of the fresh article after cooking should be labeled with a qualifying statement indicating the amount of solution remaining after cooking, for example, “After cooking, contains X % of a seasoning solution of . . . .” The ingredients of the solution may accompany the qualifying statement or appear in locations prescribed for ingredient statements. The qualifying statement must be one-fourth the size of the largest letter in the product name. If the ingredients of the solution accompany the qualifier, they must appear in print one-eighth the size of the most prominent letter in the product name. Other labeling prominence guidelines are found in Policy Memo 087A (Word Size in Labeling of Product Names and Fanciful Names). If cooked, uncured red meat products that contain added solutions prior to cooking are cooked back to or below the weight of the fresh (green weight) article, words, such as “seasoned” and “flavored,” are to be used to reflect the addition of the added substances, for example, “Seasoned Cooked Beef.” For cooked products, the % added solution for the label statement is determined by subtracting the fresh (green) weight of the article from the weight of the finished cooked product, (that is, after injecting, marinating, etc., and cooking), dividing by the weight of the finished product, and multiplying by 100. This policy is intended to apply to solutions that impart favorable flavor and other sensory characteristics, but not to solutions containing ingredients used to extend a product, such as isolated soy protein and carrageenan. Nonstandardized, raw red meat products containing added solutions must comply with 9 CFR 317.2(e)(2). See: Policy Memo 084A dated November 30, 1994 (Cooked Red Meat Products Containing Added Substances) CORN DOG OR KORN DOG: A coined name which must be accompanied by a true product name, e.g., “Batter Wrapped Franks on a Stick.” Product is limited to 65 percent batter and a minimum of 35 percent frankfurter.

A descriptive name, e.g., “Batter Wrapped Chicken Frank on a Stick,” must accompany the coined name. If the descriptive name is at least one-third the size of the coined name, the “kind” name need not precede the coined name. See: Policy Memo 061A dated September 16, 1985', 'CORN MEAL MUSH WITH BACON: Product must contain at least 15 percent cooked bacon. CORNED BEEF AND CABBAGE: Product must contain at least 25 percent cooked corned beef. CORNED BEEF (Canned, Cooked with Natural Juices): Canned product labeled “Cooked Corned Beef with Natural Juices,” is limited to 10 percent added solution before cooking. If the added solution is greater than 10 percent, the label must indicate the total added solution, e.g., “Cooked Corned Beef and Water product-X percent of weight is added ingredients.” See: Cooked Corned Beef Products With Added Substances CORNED BEEF, GRAY: Gray corned beef is not a cured product but one that contains water, salt, sugar, flavorings, etc. It should be labeled as “Gray Corned Beef,” “Gray Corned Beef Rounds,” etc. The label must show an ingredients statement rather than a curing statement as shown on other corned beef labels. CORNED BEEF WITH JUICES: Uncooked corned beef with juices (or without juices and spices) is unacceptable terminology for corned beef products meeting standards in 9 CFR 319.101 and 319.102 for corned beef brisket and corned beef round (and other cuts). The presence of free flowing juices in a package does not change this policy. The net weight includes free flowing juices. COTECHINO (IT): Pork skin sausage. Meat and meat by-products other than pork skin can be used in this product. It could also be given the name of pork skin sausage in parentheses as a common name. Italian sausage. A variety of cooked sausage. See: 9 CFR 319.140 COUNTRY: A geographical term that refers to an unincorporated area.

CURED MEAT PRODUCTS -Labeling of Mechanically Reduced: The traditional names of cured meat products, e.g., bacon, may be used even though mechanical reduction-like chopping or chunking has taken place before the product has acquired the characteristics expected of the product, provided the finished product acquires the characteristics expected. Furthermore, the mechanical reduction must be', 'noted in the product name or in a qualifier to the product name (e.g., chopped bacon or bacon-chopped and formed). See: Policy Memo 033 dated September 4, 1981 CURED MEAT PRODUCTS -Packed in Brine: Cured meat products, e.g., pork tails, pork snouts, and cured boneless beef brisket, that contain 120-200 PPM nitrite and are packed and sold in brine solution, do not require a handling statement, e.g., “Keep Refrigerated,” provided the finished product has at least 10 percent brine concentration, and the packing medium contains a sufficient quantity of salt to maintain the 10 percent brine concentration in the product. CURED PORK BELLIES: Such products are assumed to be further processed into bacon. Therefore, cured pork bellies must meet the restricted ingredients requirement for bacon. CURED PORK: Cured pork products, that contain modified food starch, X percent solution ISP, carrageenan or sodium caseinate, that fall into the PFF value of “Ham, Water Added” and the “Ham and Water product X percent solution” category, must be labeled with the appropriate PFF Nomenclature, Descriptive Labeling, e.g., “ham, water and binder product,” will be used if: 1. binders are at levels above those permitted by the regulations 2. binders other than those permitted are use 3. two or more binders are used in combination or 4. if the PFF value of the finished product falls in the “ham” or “ham with natural juice” category which do not permit binders. CURED TURKEY THIGH MEAT: A product labeled “cured turkey thigh meat” (without turkey ham in the name) must follow the turkey ham standard. The product “cured turkey thighs” (which includes skin and bone), is not required to meet the standards for turkey ham and cannot be labeled “turkey ham.” CURRIED SAUCE WITH MEAT (POULTRY) AND RICE CASSEROLE: Product must contain at least 35 percent cooked meat or poultry meat based on the sauce and meat portion only.', 'CURRY PRODUCT: 1.

These are flattened and knitted together in “cutlet” size products by means of “cubing” or “Frenching” machines, or by hand pounding with “cubing hammers.” The term “cutlet” relates to thin slices of meat. They can be identified as sliced pork meat product when the designation clearly states the specific part of the carcass from which the meat in the product is derived (e.g., “Pork Loin Cutlets”). All of the terms should be conspicuously displayed on labels. CUTLET, POULTRY: Poultry cutlets may be fabricated as opposed to using whole pieces of poultry meat. However, the term “cutlet” must be properly and distinctly qualified to describe the product, e.g.: “Turkey Cutlet From a Turkey Loaf” “Chicken Cutlet From Chicken Roll” “Turkey Cutlet, Chopped and Formed” Cooked poultry cutlets, which are solid pieces and contain added water, should not be labeled as patties. A solution statement is not needed. CUTLET VEAL: Must be a solid piece of meat from the round; slice thickness may vary. However, combining several thin slices to represent a single cutlet is not permitted. DEHYDRATED MEAT CALCULATION FACTOR: The fresh meat equivalent based on a given amount of dehydrated meat can be found by multiplying the weight of the dehydrated beef by the factor 2.8. This factor was derived as follows: Assuming canners and cutters grade beef was used, the composition of meat would be approximately 12 percent fat, 18 percent protein, 69 percent water, and 1 percent ash. Then 100 pounds of beef, when dehydrated to 5 percent moisture, would be 100 less 64 or 36 pounds dehydrated meat. Thus, 100 divided by 36 equals 2.8.', 'Assuming that the amount of dehydrated beef equivalent of 100 pounds of fresh beef is that quantity containing 18 pounds of protein, then 18 divided by the percentage of protein found by analysis of dehydrated beef would be the amount of dehydrated beef equivalent to 100 pounds of fresh meat. DEHYDRATED POULTRY CALCULATION FACTOR: The moist deboned cooked poultry or poultry meat equivalent based on a given amount of dehydrated poultry or poultry meat which can be found by multiplying the weight of the dehydrated poultry or poultry meat by the factor of 4.0. DEHYDRATED PRODUCTS WHEN WATER IS ADDED: Three methods are acceptable for listing dehydrated products. Listing of the ingredients (1) As “water, dehydrated potatoes” or “dehydrated potatoes, water,” whichever is the proper order, (2) As “reconstituted potatoes,” or (3) As “rehydrated potatoes.” If the reference was to meat instead of potatoes, the word beef, pork, or whatever was appropriate would be substituted for the word “potatoes.” DEVILED POULTRY: Is a semi plastic cured poultry food product made from finely comminuted poultry in natural proportions and containing condiments. Deviled poultry may contain poultry fat, provided that the total fat content shall not exceed 35 percent of the finished product and the moisture content shall not exceed that of the fresh unprocessed poultry. When skin is in excess of natural proportions, skin must be included in the product name (e.g. “Deviled (Kind) with (Kind) Skin Added”). DINNER DOG: A coined name -must show true product name, e.g., “A Meat and Soy Protein Concentrate Product.” DINNERS AND SUPPERS, FROZEN: Frozen products labeled as “dinner” or “supper” must weigh at least 10 ounces and shall contain at least 3 components consisting of the following: meat, poultry, cheese, eggs, vegetables, fruit, potatoes, rice or other cereal-based products (other than bread or rolls). This is not intended to include products like casseroles and stews that have all of the components combined. Sauces and gravies are not considered one of the components. They may also contain other servings of food, e.g., soup, bread or rolls, appetizer, beverage, and dessert, and these components may be included in the minimum 10-ounce net weight requirement. If meat is featured in the product name, e.g., Beef Dinner, the requirement is 25 percent or 2.5 ounces cooked meat. If a meat food product is featured in the product name, e.g., Beef Burgundy Dinner, then 25 percent or 2.5 ounces of meat', 'food product is needed. If poultry is featured in the name, e.g., Chicken Dinner, the standard is 18 percent or 2 ounces cooked deboned poultry meat, whichever is greater. However, if a poultry food product is featured in the product name, e.g., Chicken a La King Dinner, the 25 percent or 2.5 ounces of poultry food product, whichever is greater, is needed. The meat requirement for products with net weights greater than 10 ounces may be established exclusive of the appetizer, bread, and dessert, provided the remaining components weigh not less than 10 ounces. The name for dinner and supper products shall consist of or include a listing of each of the dish components in descending order of predominance by weight, for example, Fried Chicken Dinner -Fried Chicken, Mashed Potatoes, Peas and Carrots. Dinner or supper identification may appear on side panels without the complete product name shown, for example, “Fried Chicken Dinner” or “Beef Dinner.” When a dessert is one of the components of a frozen dinner or supper, i.e., a multicomponent item, it may appear out of the order of predominance in the product name and appear as the last component in the product name. DIXIE BACON: True product name, e.g., “Pork Jowl Dixie Bacon, Cured and Smoked” shall appear on the label. DIXIE SQUARE: Same as for Dixie Bacon.

There is a difference of opinion regarding the best cooler humidity. Some prefer low humidity of from 70 to 75 percent so that exposed surfaces of meat remain dry. Others use humidity’s up to 85 to 90 percent in order to purposely develop a mold growth on the outside of the meat and reduce evaporation losses. Ultraviolet light may be used to reduce microbial load in the aging room. The number of days aged does not have to appear on the label when the product is identified as ""Dry Aged"" (e.g., ""Dry Aged Beef."") DRY CURED: Product labeled as ""dry cured"" shall not be injected with a curing solution or processed by immersion in a curing solution.

Inspection personnel visiting retail markets should observe the effectiveness of this requirement. When retail outlets do not follow this identification, these facts should be immediately reported to the Food Labeling Division. ENZYME TRIMMINGS FROM ANTE-MORTEM INJECTED BEEF: Beef trimming from this operation may be used in fresh meat products without label declaration.', 'ENZYMES -PROTEOLYTIC: A 3 percent limit permitted pickup on dipped items, e.g., steak and solid pieces of meat.

Meat from this method may be used in cooked ground beef products up to 25 percent of the formula without showing the ingredients of the solution. See: 9 CFR 317.8(b)(25) 9 CFR 424.21 9 CFR 381.120 EXOTIC/NON-AMENABLE PRODUCTS-USE OF CURE AGENTS: Only amenable meat/poultry products can contain curing agents (i.e., nitrites etc.), with the exception of ratites (ostrich, rhea, emu) and squab. The prior function of nitrite and nitrate, according to FDA regulations, applies only to those species that were considered “meat” or “poultry” prior to September 1958. Therefore, amenable species that can contain cure agents are identified as the following: 1. Poultry – (domesticated birds) chicken, turkey, duck, geese, and guineas. 2. Meat – cattle, sheep, swine, and goat. Non-amenable products, such as buffalo, reindeer and pheasant, can not contain curing agents; such products are considered to be regulated under FDA regulations. However, if non-amenable products are included in an amenable product, curing agents would be permitted. The curing agents would be calculated based on both the amenable meat/poultry product and non-amenable meat/poultry product. For example, the formula includes 3 lbs. Cooked chicken and 97 lbs. buffalo. The calculation for the curing agents would be based on 100 lbs. of meat. In addition, in those situations where the meat block consists of an amenable product and a nonamenable product (refer to the example), the appropriate inspection legend should represent the amenable product. Therefore, using the example above, the label would have a poultry legend. Product derived from exotic/non-amenable species that contain over 3 percent raw meat (cattle, sheep, swine, goat, horses or other equine) are subject to inspection. The game meat used in these products must be derived from carcasses slaughtered under the Food Safety and Inspection Service. Products made with meat from exotic and non-amenable exotic species with 3 percent or less of meat or edible portion from cattle, sheep, swine, goat, horses or other equine, or up to 30 percent fat from these species are non-amenable provided the only reference to meat or meat byproducts on the labeling is in the statement of ingredients and the product name includes the term “flavored with (amenable species).”', '---- Custom prepared products composed of meat from exotic/nonamenable species and up to 30 percent animal fat are not amenable. Labeling such products with the term applies (see: 303.1 (a) (2)). Products made with meat from game animals with 3 percent or less of meat or edible portion from cattle, sheep, swine, goat, or up to 30 percent meat fats provided the only reference to meat or meat byproducts on the labeling is in the statement of ingredients or referred to as “flavored with.” Custom prepared products composed of meat from game animals and up to 30 percent animal fat. Labeling “Not For Sale” applies. See: 303.1 (a)(2) Buffalo and venison must be federally or state inspected; however, venison may also be produced under the supervision of inspection officials of a country approved to export meat products into the United States. All other meat from exotic/nonamenable species that is used in formulating amenable products must be derived from carcasses slaughtered under the Food Safety and Inspection Service. EXTRA AND MORE THAN: The terms “extra” or “more (component) than” may be used provided the following guidelines are followed: (1) There is at least a 10 percent increase in the particular component of interest over the amount that is found in the usual or “regular” formulation. (2) Information must be provided with the label application that compares the product formulation containing the “extra” amount of the component to the regular formulation of the same product to establish that at least a 10 percent increase in the component has occurred. Therefore, the usual or “regular” component claims at the time of label review must be presented so that the necessary comparison of formulations can be made. (3) In the situation where production of the “regular” product formulation ceases, the “extra” or “more (component) than” product labels would be given a 6-months temporary approval. (4) A comparison to a similar product on the market may be made to support the “extra” or “more/than” type claim, provided suitable market basket data are submitted with the label application that establish the similarity of formulations and show the increased amount of the component over the “usual” amount. See: Policy Memo 118 dated October 31, 1988', 'FABRICATED STEAK: 1. Steaks that include large sections or pieces of meat that are molded or shaped to form one large piece and then sliced. A qualifier such as “formed” must be included in the product name. 2. Raw fabricated steaks with added solutions must be labeled in accordance with 9 CFR 317.2(e)(2). 3. Antioxidants are permitted. 4. When made from simulated fat covering and or marbling, the product name must contain a truthful descriptive designation, for example, “artificially marbled-simulated fat covered beef steak.” FAJITAS: The Spanish translation is “little belts” or strips of meat. Fajitas are strips of seasoned or marinated red meat or poultry meat, which have been cooked.

The Product must be trichina-treated. FIBER PRODUCTS: Fiber products such as bran are acceptable only in non specific products.', 'Fiber type foods are permitted in meat and poultry products and must be identified by heir common or usual name, such as oat bran. However, fiber is not permitted in meat or poultry products, e.g., soy fiber, oat fiber, and wheat fiber. Presently, there is no recognized definition for fiber. FILLET STYLE: “Fillet style” must be qualified, e.g., “chunked and formed,” if the meat or poultry product is not made from a solid piece of meat or poultry. The term “fillet” is defined as a solid piece of meat or poultry. FLANKEN IN THE POT: The product must contain at least 25 percent beef. Product is made from beef plates and may contain such components as Matzo Balls, Noodles, and Vegetables.

GEOGRAPHIC AND RELATED TERMS (REQUIREMENTS FOR THE USE ON PRODUCT LABELS): Any label representation that expresses or implies a particular geographical origin of the product, or any ingredient of the product, shall not be used except when such representation is: 1. A truthful representation of geographical origin, e.g., “Virginia Ham” for a ham produced in the State of Virginia; or 2. A trademark or trade name which: a. has been so long and exclusively used by a manufacturer or distributor that it is generally understood by consumers to mean the product of the particular manufacturer or distributor, e.g., “Swiss Chalet;” or b. is so arbitrary or fanciful that it is generally understood by the consumer not to suggest geographical origin, e.g., “Moon Sausage;” or 3. A part of the name required or allowed by an applicable Federal law, regulation or standard, e.g., “Frankfurter,” “Vienna;” or 4. A name whose market significance is generally understood by consumers to connote a particular class, kind, type or style of product, or preparation rather than to indicate geographical origin of the product, e.g., “Mexican Style Dinner,” “Italian Style Pizza.” Such terms must be qualified with the word “style” or “type,” unless specifically approved by the Administrator as a generic term, e.g., “Lebanon Bologna,” “Genoa Salami,” Milan Salami.” Any geographical representation that does not meet the aforementioned guidelines should be qualified by the word “brand,” provided that the word “brand” is not used in such a way as to be false or misleading. A qualifying statement identifying the place where the product was actually made is required in proximity to the brand name, e.g., “Milwaukee Brand Bacon, Made in Chicago, Illinois.” The word “Brand” must be in the same size', 'and style of type as the geographical term. If the product has a foreign brand name, it may be identified as having been made in this country, e.g., “Scandinavian Brand Bacon, Made in U.S.A.”. See: Policy Memo 068 dated February 9, 1984 GEOGRAPHIC TERMS: 1. Country, Ranch, and Farm in Trade, Branch and Fanciful Names: Trade names, brand names, or fanciful names that include the words country, ranch, or farm, e.g., “Country Kitchen,” “Ranch House,” “Hickory Farms,” or “Carabeef Ranch Brand” do not invoke section 9 CFR 317.8 of the regulations regarding the use of the term “Country” or “Farm”. However, if the terms are used alone in conjunction with the product name, e.g., “Country Stew,” then such products must be prepared in the country or on the ranch or farm and meet any other requirements prescribed. 2. Southern: The term “Southern” is restricted to use only in areas south of the Mason-Dixon Line and east of the Mississippi River as well as Arkansas, Louisiana, and Missouri, which are also considered southern states.

The product must contain an equal number of livers, hearts, and gizzards.', 'GIBLETS AND/OR NECKS SOLD WITH CARCASSES: Poultry giblets consist of approximately equal numbers of hearts, gizzards, and livers, as determined on a count basis. Rabbit giblets consist of the liver and heart. Although often packaged with them, the neck is not a giblet. Giblet packs are expected within the cavities of eviscerated whole birds or eviscerated whole rabbits or when packaged with cut-up whole birds or cut-up whole rabbits, therefore, qualifying the presence of giblets is not required on labeling. However, when giblets are not expected, a product name qualifier is required, e.g., “Packed with Giblets.” In situations where parts of giblets are missing, a product name qualifier is required, e.g., “Parts of Giblets Missing” or “Parts of Giblets May Be Missing.” In situations where the giblets are missing entirely from an eviscerated carcass or a cut-up whole carcass, a product name qualifier is required, e.g., “Packed Without Giblets.” In addition, an excess of one of the giblet components can not be added to make up for another missing giblet component. In this case, a proper qualifying statement is required, e.g., “Packed with 2 Gizzards, 1 Liver.” A neck, when not attached to the carcass of a whole bird, is also expected to be present within the carcass or packed with the cut-up whole carcass. Accordingly, a product name qualifier is not required to flag the presence of the neck. Rather, when the neck is missing, a product name qualifier is required, e.g., “Without Neck.” See: 9 CFR 381.170 (b) (21) and 9 CFR 354.

However, official grade names may be used for non-graded species products, provided they do not reference US, USDA, or are enclosed in or near an official grade shield. For example, Prime Ham or Choice Pork Shoulder. Grade marks for products imported from foreign countries can only use that countries grading system. Foreign countries cannot use USDA, AMS grading terminology, i.e., prime, choice, select on foreign product entering or processed in the U.S. The grading term “good” on poultry is considered puffery and is acceptable. Meat (beef, veal, and lamb) grading terms, “prime,” “choice,” “select,” may not be used immediately preceding “kind” poultry, unless the poultry is equivalent to USDA Grade A.

HYDROLYZED BEEF STOCK: A beef stock which has been treated with acid, alkali, or enzymes to digest the protein. The protein molecules are broken down into amino acids, peptides, polypeptides, and peptones. As the digestion is carried out for longer periods of time, more and more of the larger molecules are broken down into amino acids, with free alpha-amino groups. By analyzing these alpha-amino nitrogens one can determine the degree of hydrolysis. 100 percent hydrolysis would mean that all the nitrogen (protein) is in the form of amino acids. 10 percent of hydrolysis would mean that only 10 percent of the nitrogen is in the form of free amino acids, while the rest is still present in polymeric form."", 'The label should indicate the degree of hydrolysis. This is determined from the ratio of amino nitrogen to total nitrogen. amino nitrogen = percent hydrolysis total nitrogen A product labeled 50 percent Hydrolyzed Beef Stock must, therefore, have 50 percent of the total nitrogen present as amino nitrogen. Adding percent solids is optional. The percent solids would not necessarily be the same percent as hydrolysis depending on the thickness (consistency) of product. HYDROLYZED GELATIN: Hydrolyzed gelatin is permitted in frankfurters and similar products (9 CFR 319.180) at levels typically used for flavorings (less than 2 percent). Hydrolyzed gelatin may currently be used a 2 percent in 9 CFR 319.180 and like products as a flavoring. If gelatin is used in a product, make sure it is permitted for use in the product. Hydrolyzed gelatin is acceptable in poultry franks 9 CFR 319.180 and like products at levels not to exceed 2 percent of total formula until otherwise notified. Hydrolyzed gelatin is recognized as a binder rather than flavoring and may be used at levels of 2 percent or less in 9 CFR 319.180 type products. HYDROLYZED OAT FLOUR: Hydrolyzed oat flour is safe and may be used in non-standardized meat/poultry products as a binder at below typical binder use levels, i.e., 3 percent. It may be used in low fat hamburger, water, and hydrolyzed oat flour product as per Policy Memo 121. HYDROLYZED PROTEIN: “Hydrolyzed Protein (milk, egg, soy)” is an acceptable common or usual name provided all components are hydrolyzed. “Hydrolyzed Protein (potato, gelatin)” is an unacceptable ingredient declaration and must be declared as “hydrolyzed potato protein and hydrolyzed gelatin.” Salt is present in hydrolyzed protein and must appear in the sublisting of the hydrolyzed protein if it does not appear elsewhere in the ingredients statement. HYDROXYPROPYL METHYLCELLULOSE (HPMC): Emulsifying agent, binder, thickener, and a stabilizer. This is accepted for its emulsifying qualities when prepared as a solution and applied as a dip. 1. Not more than 2 percent in solution.', '2. Not more than 4 percent weight gained in product. 3. Not more than .08 percent hydroxypropyl methylcellulose in finished product. 4. Must be identified in the ingredients statement for purpose. 5. Approved on individual basis only. ICE GLAZES WITH FLAVOR: If an ice glaze component contributes to the flavor profile of the product, the ice glaze coating must be counted toward the total net weight of the finished product. In addition, the product name must contain a descriptive designation for the coating and coating percentage in accordance with 9 CFR 317.2(e)(2) or 381.117(h), for example, “raw chicken breast filets with rib meat containing up to 16% of a solution of water seasonings and salt and coated with 6.5% butter garlic seasoning.” Or, if the same solution is used for injection (or by any other method of incorporation) and for the ice glaze coating the percentages may be combined, for example, “chicken breast filets with rib meat, containing and glazed with up to 22.5% of a solution of water, salt, seasonings, and garlic.” ICE-GLAZED BREADED CHICKEN NUGGETS: If an ice glaze is applied for the purpose of setting the breading, the term “ice glazed” needs to appear in close contiguous to the product name. The water cannot be included as part of the net weight statement and the transmittal form should indicated this. IMITATION FLAVORS: Imitation beef flavor, imitation mushroom flavor, flavor base for gravies and similar substances which enhance, fortify, or help to simulate a flavor are usually composed of food additives and, as such, are not “artificial flavors” for labeling purposes. This class of imitation flavors can be composed of such ingredients as flour, fats, oils, salt, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, vegetable gums, thiamine hydrochloride, beta alanine, disodium inosinate, glutamic acid, and a host of other ingredients. These flavorings must be identified on labels by showing each individual ingredient by its common name. Class names, e.g., amino acids are not acceptable. Each specific amino acid must be listed. INCIDENTAL ADDITIVES: As defined in the Food and Drug Administration regulations (21 CFR 101.100(a)(3)), incidental additives are substances present in foods at insignificant levels and that do not serve a technical or functional effect in that food. In determining whether a substance is an incidental additive, the following criteria may be applied: 1. Substances that are present in a food as a result of having been present in an ingredient added to the food and have a technical or functional effect on the', 'ingredient but not on the finished food, or 2. Substances that are processing aids, defined as: a. substances added during processing but removed before the food is packaged in its finished form, or b. substances added during processing but that are converted to constituents normally present in the food, and do not significantly increase the amount of those constituents naturally found in the food, or', 'c. substances that are added to a food for their technical or functional effect in the processing but are present in the finished food at insignificant levels and do not have any technical or functional effect in that food. INGREDIENT LABELING: 1. All ingredients in FDA standardized products, e.g., Cheddar Cheese (Water, salt, cheddar, etc.), and on standardized products, e.g., Soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, require complete disclosure of all ingredients on the labels of meat and poultry products. 2. Protein hydrolysates must identify the common and usual names and identify the source from which the protein is derived, e.g., “hydrolyzed vegetable protein” would be declared as “hydrolyzed corn protein.” 3. FDA certified color additives require the listing of the common or usual names, e.g., FD&C Blue No. 1, Blue 1, or Blue 1 Lake. Color additives not subject to certification may be declared as “artificial color,” “artificial color added,” or “color added.” Alternatively, color additives not subject to certification may be declared as “colored with ,” or “ color,” with blank space filled in with the name of the color additive listed in 21 CFR 73, e.g., “colored with annatto” or “caramel color.” 4. Cured meat products used as ingredients, regardless of their level of use, require complete disclosure of all ingredients in the formulation of meat and poultry products. See: FSIS Directive 7237.1, Rev. 1, “Labeling of Ingredients” FSIS Directive 7140.1, Rev. 1, “Questions and Answers Relating to Ingredients” INSERT LABELS FOR USE AT RETAIL STORES: No inspection legend is permitted on insert labels. INSPECTION LEGENDS (DUAL): Products consisting of mixed meat and poultry ingredients shall bear either the official meat inspection legend or poultry legend, depending on which ingredients are present in the greater amounts. If meat or poultry ingredients exist in equal proportions, either official legend may be used. If meat and poultry ingredients exist in exact proportions and both appear in the product name, the official legend must reflect the ingredient appearing first in the product name. Containers of products intended for sale to household consumers can bear only the official mark of inspection of the product enclosed. Containers of products intended for distribution to other than the retail trade may bear both the official meat inspection legend and the official poultry products inspection legend.', ""See: Policy Memo 075 dated August 14, 1984 INSPECTION MARK ON WING TAG: When the inspection mark is shown on a wing tag, either the plant number or the firm's name and address must also appear. INTESTINES: Intestines can be prepared as edible product and bear the mark of inspection. IRISH STEW: Product does not require a geographical qualifying statement nor the words, “Style,” “Type,” or “Brand.” Usually it contains lamb or mutton but beef may be used. It must meet the stew standard. Vegetables include onions, carrots, potatoes, and turnips. Dumplings are often used. Beans are not acceptable in “Irish Stew.” ISOLATED SOY PROTEIN: This food ingredient is similar to soy protein concentrate except that additional extraction has removed more of the non-protein fraction, thereby increasing its protein content. It is prepared by alkaline solubilization of the soy protein and then precipitation of same in an acid bath. It may be powdered, extruded, or spun into fibrils and has a protein content of 90 to 95 percent. Products of spun fibrils may be referred to as “Textured Soy Protein Isolate,” “Isolated Soy Protein Fibers,” or “Spun Isolated Soy Protein.” The PER of isolated soy protein is about 1.9 and indicates a poorer quality protein than that of soy flour or soy protein concentrate (PER 2.2). When hydrated textured (structured) protein isolate is added to meat food products, the ingredients statement should read “Hydrated Textured (Structured) Isolated Soy Protein.” ITALIAN SAUSAGE: Beef and pork Italian sausage is acceptable. Tomato products and other unexpected ingredients can be added if the product name indicates their presence. Red pepper permitted under 9 CFR 319.145(b)(1). See: 9 CFR 319.145 ITALIAN STYLE: Acceptable term for products containing anise or fennel or Italian type cheese (e.g., Mozzarella, Parmesan, Provolone, Ricotta, Romano) or at least three of the following: basil, garlic, marjoram, olive oil, or oregano. Sausage products must meet the Italian Sausage requirements as per Regulation 9 CFR 319.145."", 'ITALIAN STYLE SMOKED SAUSAGE: This is a smoked sausage (10 percent added water) and is not a 9 CFR 319.145 (Italian sausage) product. However, the product must contain Italian style ingredients found in the policy book under Italian style. JAGWURST: The product is the same as yachtwurst (The Americanized name for the item). It is a cooked sausage made from a fine emulsion with cubes of lean meat rather than fat (as in mortadella). JAMAICAN STYLE: Term may be used to identify meat and poultry food products made with allspice, garlic, onion, red pepper, and thyme. The name of the product must be further qualified with a statement, like “with Jamaican Style Seasoning,” e.g., “Jamaican Style Chicken Wings-with Jamaican Style Seasonings.” If the product formula contains textured soy product, then the ration rules apply. JAMAICAN STYLE PATTIES: Product has at least 25 percent meat enclosed in a crust. The label must show true product name, e.g., “Beef Turnover.” If the formula contains textured soy product, then the ratio rules apply. JAMON: Spanish word for “ham.” In the usage of Spanish-speaking people outside Spain, it has come to mean cured pork. “Jamon di Cocinar” is cured pork for cooking as opposed to slicing. When the term “Jamon” appears before the name of a limb, it means the product is cured. With the exception of products available for sale in Puerto Rico, all Spanish product names followed with the English translation. Examples of acceptable product names are: Jamon de Paleta -Cured Pork Shoulder Jamon de Pierna -Cured Pork Leg JARDINIERE (FR): Must contain at least 50 percent cooked meat based on total product. It means “in the manner of the gardener.” The term applies to dishes made with diced garden vegetables which have been cooked with meat. Jardiniere should be followed by a true product name, e.g., “Beef with Vegetables.”', 'JERK OR JERK STYLE: The terms “JERK” or “JERK STYLE” can be used to describe red meat or poultry whole muscle, fabricated products, and other meat poultry food products that are mixed or placed in a “spicy seasoning.” The seasoning usually contains scallion, onion, thyme, allspice (pimento), hot peppers, and usually contains at least one or more of the following: nutmeg, cinnamon, sugar, brown sugar, garlic, and rice or wine vinegar. The seasoning may be in the form of paste, marinade, sauce, or dry seasoning mixture. The product is mixed or placed in the spicy hot seasoning raw or the product may be grilled, cooked, or smoked. Examples of acceptable product names are, for example, “Oven Roasted Jerk Chicken”, “Jerk Pork Sausage” or “Jerk Style Smoked Beef Sausage.” Raw “jerk” or “jerk style” meat or poultry products with added solutions must be labeled in accordance with 9 CFR 317.2(e)(2) or 9 CFR 381.117(h), for example, “Jerk Style Beef containing 10% marinade of water and spicy seasoning.” JERKY: All Jerky products must have a MPR of 0.75:1 or less; “species” or “kind” must be in the name. Products may be cured or uncured, dried, and may be smoked or unsmoked, air or oven dried. A reference to the particular type of drying method is not a labeling requirement. 1. “Beef Jerky” -Produced from a single piece of beef. May also be classified as “Natural Style Beef Jerky” provided this product name is accompanied by the explanatory statement “made from solid pieces of beef” or comparable terminology. When a “Natural” claim (not natural style) is made, the policies as outlined in Policy Memo 055 are to be applied. 2. “Beef Jerky Chunked and Formed” -Produced from chunks which are molded and formed and cut into strips. 3. “Beef Jerky Ground and Formed or Chopped and Formed” -Produced as described, molded and formed and cut into strips. 4. Jerky products that contain over 3½ percent binders (2 percent ISP) must reflect the binder in the product name, i.e., “Beef Soy Protein Concentrate jerky, ground and formed. Jerky products that contain binders at levels below 3½ percent should express the binder in a qualifying statement, e.g., beef jerky -soy protein added.', '5. “Species (or Kind) Jerky Sausage.” The word “Jerky” can appear on labels for product in which the “species” or “kind” has been processed by chopping or grinding and stuffed into casings under the following conditions only: a. The word “Sausage” must appear immediately contiguous to “Jerky” whenever it is shown. “Sausage” must be in type at least one-third as high as “Jerky” in the same color ink and on the same background. The words “stick,” “piece” etc. cannot be used as substitutes for “sausage” in the product name. “Sausage” means that the product has been chopped. b. The product may be dried at any stage of the process. JUNIOR MEAT SNACKS: Product must conform to the sausage standards going into the jar before processing. Limited to 3 1/2 percent extenders. JUNIPER BERRIES: Juniper berries and twigs are normally thrown on the fire from which dry cured hams are smoked. Juniper berries have been approved in the curing ingredients of Westphalian Ham. KABOBS: Product consists of chunks of red meat or poultry and vegetables placed on a metal or wooden skewer. “Kabob” may be included in the descriptive name, e.g., “Beef, Mushrooms, and Onion Kabob.” A kabob may be cooked or uncooked, but the label must clearly indicate this. This product may contain but does not require vegetables. KALBELWURST: Product is similar to Bockwurst with no limit on water or milk. KATRIFITAS: A coined word used to describe a type of empanadillas. The product consists of dough containing yucca made to resemble a meat turnover and has a special meat filling.

It contains sodium alginate, calcium carbonate, and disodium phosphate. The amount of disodium phosphate in the finished product is approximately 0.099 percent. Its use should be judged on an individual basis.', 'KIDNEYS FROM ENZYME INJECTED BEEF: Product may be exported to other countries. They must be labeled “Beef Kidneys, Tendered with Papain -For Export Only.” KIELBASA: A sausage that is cured, cooked, and usually smoked. Kolbassy is Czechoslovakian spelling; other variations include Kielbassy, Kolbasa and Kolbase. Kielbasa is made from coarsely ground pork or coarsely ground pork with added beef or mutton. “Hungarian Style Kolbase” is finely ground product, seasoned and stuffed into casings. The 70/30 rule can be used, however, pork must always be the predominant meat ingredient. “Beef Kielbasa” is prepared with only beef as the meat ingredient. Byproducts are not permitted ingredients in these sausages. An uncured (fresh), uncooked variety, with no more than 3 percent water exists. “Fresh” shall be used in the name when the product is uncured. When fresh Kielbasa is cooked or smoked, then cooked or smoked is required in the product name. The requirements of Policy Memo 110 apply when these perishable, cooked, uncured products are packaged in hermetically sealed containers. KIPPERED BEEF: A cured dry product similar to beef jerky but not as dry. MPR of 2.03:1 is applied to product. KISKA; Kisba, Kishka, or Stuffed Derma. Ingredients statement is part of the product name. A meat food product prepared two ways: 1.

Exceptions would require that the establishment operators develop a procedure which the assigned inspector can readily monitor to ensure correct labeling. Such procedures, accompanied by written comments from the assigned inspector and where possible, the circuit supervisor, must be forwarded to the area supervisor for review and approval. Approved procedures must be attached to the label records accompanying new or modified labels submitted for approval. See: Policy Memo 083A dated May 12, 1988 LABELING FOR SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS: If a product fails to comply with a standard only because the meat or poultry content is lower than required and the product has generic identity as a nonmeat product (e.g., pizza, stew, pies), then the product may be designated by the nonmeat terminology in the standardized name (e.g., “PIZZA,” “STEW,” “PIE”), provided the meat/poultry content of the product is conspicuously disclosed contiguous to the product name along with a', 'statement of the amount of meat/poultry in the standardized product. (For example, PIZZA (contains 5 percent sausage; SAUSAGE PIZZA contains 12 percent sausage.) Such product may not be nutritionally inferior to the standardized product it resembles. For this purpose, nutritional inferiority is defined, consistent with the requirement of 21 CFR 101.3(e)(4), as any reduction in the content of an essential nutrient that is present at 2 percent or more of the U.S. RDA per serving of protein or any of the vitamins or minerals for which U.S. RDAs are established. A quality control procedure must be approved for such products by the Processed Products Inspection Division before the label can be used. If a product is nutritionally inferior to the standardized product it resembles, it must be labeled “imitation” in accordance with 9 CFR 317.2(j) and 9 CFR 381.1(b). See: Policy Memo 069 dated March 23, 1984 LABELING OF PRODUCTS WITH GROUND OR EMULSIFIED TRIMMINGS: The addition of small amounts of ground or emulsified ham trimmings, beef trimmings, or poultry trimmings to these products may be used without declaration. However, if poultry skin is being used to produce poultry trimmings, it may not exceed natural proportions as prescribed in 9 CFR 381.117 and 381.118 of the Poultry Products Inspection Regulations. The amount of ground or emulsified trimmings that may be used can represent no more than 15 percent of the fresh or green weight of the ham, beef, or poultry block at the time of formulation (e.g., 85 lbs. intact muscle and 15 lbs. of trimmings). These trimmings may be from a different process, however, they must be derived from like cuts or parts, e.g., emulsified round trimmings injected into product called ""Boneless Roast Beef Round,"" emulsified breast meat trimmings injected into product called ""Boneless Roasted Turkey Breast,"" or emulsified chuck trimmings injected into product called ""Cooked Roast Beef"" derived from the beef chuck. The information pertaining to the source of trimmings and cut of product being used must be indicated in the product formulation on label submittals. Emulsified trimmings consist of suspending ground trimmings in a curing solution or other solutions (i.e., that impart flavor) through the use of a mechanical emulsifier, then injecting the liquid suspension directly into the whole muscle portion of the hams, beef roasts, or poultry products. The emulsified suspension must be used during the same day of production. Furthermore, a written proposal outlining processing procedures for injecting the suspensions of ham, beef, or poultry trimmings into the boneless product must be submitted by establishments, through appropriate inspection channels, to the Processed Products Inspection Division, Science and Technology, for review and approval. Such approval is a prerequisite for label use. Products containing more than 15 percent ground trimmings or emulsified trimmings must be labeled to indicate the presence of the ground ham, beef or poultry trimmings added or emulsified ham, beef or poultry trimmings being injected, e.g., ""A Portion of Ground Ham Added,"" ""Emulsified Beef Added,"" ""Ground Poultry Trimmings', 'Added,"" or ""Emulsified Beef Trimmings Added."" Policies regarding the required use of terminology such as ""chunked and formed"" and ""ground and formed"" will continue. See: Policy Memo 041B dated February 15, 1991 LABELING OF MODIFIED BREAKFAST SAUSAGE, COOKED SAUSAGE, AND FERMENTED SAUSAGE PRODUCTS IDENTIFIED BY A NUTRIENT CONTENT CLAIM: Modified breakfast sausage, cooked sausage, and fermented sausage products are substitute versions of the standardized or traditional products that have been formulated and processed to reduce the fat contents to qualify for use of nutrient content claims, but do not comply with the standard of identity or composition as described in the meat and poultry regulations or the Standards and Labeling Policy Book (Policy Book) because of the use of ingredients used for fat replacement which are precluded or restricted by these standards. The deviation from the standard or the traditional, i.e., “regular product,” is conveyed by associating an expressed nutrient content claim for the appropriate reduction in fat content and the standardized or traditional product name, e.g., “Reduced Fat Frankfurter” or “Low Fat Pepperoni.” The nutrient content claims that may be used are those related to a reduction in fat contents that are identified in the regulations for meat products in 9 CFR Part 317 and for poultry products in 9 CFR Part 381. Maintaining Product Integrity: The following guidelines must be applied to assure that the modified versions of the subject meat and poultry sausage products do not violate the integrity of the standardized or traditional product for which they purport to be substitutes: (1) the product must be similar in shape, flavor, consistency, and general appearance to the product as prepared according to the regulatory or traditional standard, (2) the meat or poultry used to formulate the modified product must come from the same anatomical location when the standardized term is related to an anatomical region on an animal, e.g., “ham” is expected to be from the hind leg of the hog and cured; thus, “lean smoked ham sausage” would be comprised of meat from the hind leg of a hog that has been smoked and cured, (3) the modified sausage product must result from the same processing procedures as those specified for the subject sausage products described by regulatory or Policy Book standards, (4) there must not be deviations from product safety criteria (e.g., salt content, curing agents, pH, water activity and/or moisture/protein ratio) that are provided in the regulatory or Policy Book standards for sausages, and (5) the modified product must achieve the appropriate reduction in fat content to be eligible to use a nutrient content claim in conjunction with the standardized or traditional product name. Performance Characteristics: In producing modified, substitute versions of sausages, the deviations from ingredient provisions of the regulatory and Policy Book standards should be the minimum necessary to qualify for the nutrient content claim while maintaining the performance characteristics similar to the standardized or traditional product, i.e., similar preparation, cooking, and handling characteristics. If a modified version of the standardized or traditional sausage does not perform in substantially the same way as the standardized or traditional item, the label must include a prominent statement informing', 'the consumer of such differences. For example, a “low fat frankfurter” that essentially has all of the characteristics of a frankfurter, but cannot be grilled, would indicate “not recommended for grilling.” A “reduced fat pepperoni” that displays essentially all the characteristics of pepperoni, but cannot be cooked, would, for example, indicate “not recommended for cooking” or “do not cook.” Safe and Suitable Ingredients: A modified, substitute sausage product must be formulated with approved safe and suitable ingredients, e.g., those identified in 9 CFR 424.21, and those determined to be safe and suitable by the Food Standards and Ingredients Branch, Product Assessment Division. Such ingredients are to be used at the lowest level necessary to achieve the intended effect of reducing fat as compared to the standardized or traditional product. Safe and suitable ingredients are those used to replace fat, improve texture, and prevent syneresis. An ingredient or component of an ingredient that is specifically required by the regulatory or Policy Book standard for characterizing purposes, e.g., cheese in a cheesefurter, fresh livers in liver sausage, cured ham in a ham sausage, and fennel or anise in an Italian sausage, shall be present in the required amount, if applicable, or otherwise in a significant amount to provide a characterizing identity to the product. Moreover, an ingredient or component of an ingredient that is not permitted by regulations for use in any meat or poultry sausage product, e.g., sodium benzoate, shall not be added to a modified, substitute product. Product Identity: The name of the modified version of the standardized or traditional product that complies with all parts of the policy prescribed herein is the appropriate expressed nutrient content claim for the meat and/or poultry product with a reduction in fat content and the applicable standardized or traditional term, e.g., “Lean Sausage,” “97 percent Fat-Free (or “Low Fat”) Kielbasa,” “Low-Fat Frankfurter Made with Beef, Pork and Turkey,” “Reduced Fat Pepperoni,” “Extra Lean Turkey Italian Sausage,” and “Lite Genoa Salami.” The size and style of type must conform to the nutrition labeling regulations. Ingredients Statement: To assist the consumer in differentiating between the standardized or traditional sausage product and the modified, substitute version, ingredients that are not provided for by regulatory or Policy Book standards, or used in excess of the allowable levels specified, must be appropriately identified with an asterisk in the ingredients statement. The statement(s) defining the asterisk(s), e.g., “*Ingredient(s) not in regular “(fill in name of the standardized or traditional product), or “*Ingredients(s) in excess of amount permitted in regular “(fill in name of the standardized or traditional product), or both as appropriate, must be legible and conspicuous, and shall immediately follow the ingredients statement in the same size and style of type. See: Policy Memo 123 dated January 20, 1995', 'LABELING OF MEAT AND POULTRY STICK ITEMS: Stick items such as beef jerky, pepperoni sticks, and beef sticks must be labeled (i.e., contain the required label features as outlined in 9 CFR 317 and 9 CFR 381, Subpart N) according to the following guidelines: 1. If sold in fully labeled bulk containers, i.e., canisters, caddies, or similar containers, stick items do not have to be fully labeled unless they are individually wrapped. This type of container cannot be reused. 2. If sold in bulk containers, i.e., canisters, caddies, or similar containers that are not fully labeled, stick items must be fully labeled. Bulk containers such as these may only be refilled with fully labeled product. 3. If sold in small, fully labeled cartons, boxes, or similar containers (e.g., 3 oz., net weight) that are only intended for retail sale intact, stick items may be individually wrapped and unlabeled. See: Policy Memo 111 dated June 6, 1988 LABELING OF MODIFIED SUBSTITUTE VERSIONS OF FRESH (SPECIES) SAUSAGE, HAMBURGER OR GROUND BEEF PRODUCTS: This policy allows modified versions of fresh (species) sausages, ground beef, or hamburger to contain non-meat or poultry, “fat-replacing ingredients” (e.g., binders such as carrageenan, modified food starch) and to be identified by certain nutrient content claims in accordance with nutrition labeling regulations effective on August 8, 1994, in conjunction with descriptive labeling, e.g., “Lean Pork Sausage with a X percent Solution of ...,” or “Low Fat Ground Beef, Water, and Carrageenan Product.” This policy allows for the use of terms defined in regulations, e.g., “Lean,” “Reduced Fat,” “Low Fat,” etc., to be used to describe fresh (species) sausage, ground beef, or hamburger products with a reduction in fat content resulting from the use of added ingredients (i.e., “fat replacers” such as carrageenan and isolated soy protein). These products must meet the criteria for use of the nutrient content claim associated with the fat reduction. The nutrient content claim may be used in conjunction with the standardized name provided the consumer is informed of the actual components of the product through labeling, i.e., descriptive product name, ingredients statement, and Nutrition Facts. Meat products, including those that meet the criteria established for claims, such as “Lean,” “Low Fat,” “Lower Fat,” “Reduced Fat,” etc., that combine fresh (species) sausage, ground beef, or hamburger, and other safe and suitable ingredients, for the principal purpose of replacing fat, may be descriptively labeled. Examples of such products are “Lean Ground Beef, Water, and Carrageenan Product,” “Low Fat Ground Beef With a X percent Solution of ...,” “Lean Beef Sausage, Water, and Carrageenan', 'Product,” or “Reduced Fat Pork Sausage, Water, and Binders Product,” provided conditions prescribed in the regulations, viz., 9 CFR 317, for use of the nutrient content claim are satisfied. In contrast, modified versions of fresh (species) sausage, ground beef or hamburger product containing added ingredients that do not qualify for use of a nutrient content claim prescribed in the nutrition labeling regulations must be labeled as Imitation Pork Sausage, Imitation Beef Sausage, Imitation Ground Beef, Imitation Hamburger, Beef Patty or Beef Patty Mix in accordance with 9 CFR Section 317.2(j)(1) and Sections 9 CFR 319.141 (Fresh pork sausage), 319.142 (Fresh beef sausage), and 319.15 (Miscellaneous beef products), respectively. Descriptively labeled, modified, substitute versions of fresh (species) sausage, ground beef, or hamburger product with a reduction in fat content must comply with the following guidelines: 1. The descriptive name of a modified, substitute product with a reduction in fat content is the applicable nutrient content claim used in conjunction with the appropriate standardized name and fat-replacing ingredients, e.g., “Low Fat Ground Beef, Water and Carrageenan Product,” or “Lean Pork Sausage with an X percent Solution of Water, Modified Food Starch, Spices, and Salt.” Words in the descriptive name may be of a different size, style, color, or type but, in all cases, the words must be prominent, conspicuous, and legible. Moreover, no word in the descriptive name should be printed in letters that are less than one-third the size of the largest letter used in any other word in the descriptive name. The solution statement, when used, is considered to be part of the descriptive product name and must comply with descriptive name sizing requirements. 2. Fat-replacing ingredients (e.g., binders and water) and fat in the finished product may not exceed 30 percent of the product as formulated for the modified, substitute ground beef, hamburger, or fresh beef sausage product, and no more than 40 percent of the product formulation for the substitute fresh pork sausage. The fat content must be in accordance with requirements for use of the applicable nutrient content claim. 3.

See: Policy Memo 121B dated January 20, 1995 LABELING OF PRODUCT NAMES, FANCIFUL NAMES, WORD SIZE: Words in product names or fanciful names may be a different size, style, color, or type, but in all cases, the words must be prominent, conspicuous, and legible. Moreover, no', 'word in a product name, i.e., a common or usual name, a standardized name, or a descriptive name should be printed in letters that are less than one-third the size of the largest letter used in any other words of the product name. The same guidelines apply to letters of words in fanciful names that may accompany the product name. For example, for a product labeled Chili Mac--Beans, Macaroni and Beef in Sauce, “Chili Mac” is the fanciful name and “Beans, Macaroni and Beef in Sauce” is the product name. No letter in “Chili Mac” may be smaller than one-third the size of the largest letter in “Chili Mac.” Similarly, no letter in the descriptive name may be smaller than one-third the size of the largest letter in the descriptive name.

MEXICAN STYLE SAUCES: A garnish (decoration) of cheese in or on the sauce of Mexican style foods does not require the presence of the cheese to be declared in the product name or qualifying statement. MILAN OR MILANO SALAMI: A dry sausage with a maximum MPR of 1.9:1. It is an Italian-type salami, except the meat is finely cut. It is made with beef, pork fat, spiced with garlic, and has a distinctive cording.', 'MINCE MEAT: Product must contain at least 12 percent fresh meat or 9 percent cooked meat. Heart meat may be substituted. In addition to “Mince Meat,” the product name should include kinds of meat, e.g., “Mince Meat with Beef” or “Mince Meat with (species) Heart Meat.” When 2 percent or more cooked meat but less than 9 percent cooked meat is present in the formula, the product is amenable and the name must state that the product is “Mince Meat Flavored With .” A product marketed as “Mince Meat” which contains less than 2 percent cooked meat or contains only beef suet as the ingredient of animal origin, is not considered as a meat food product and is not amenable. MIXTURES: Mixtures of nonfat dry milk (NFDM), calcium reduced dry skim milk (CRDSM), or dried whey, reduced lactose whey, reduced minerals whey, and whey protein concentrate with other substances are not allowed, except in batter and gravy mixes and breaders. Mixtures of cereal, soy preparations and/or sodium caseinate with other substances are permitted to come into the plant for use in batter and gravy mixes, but they must be labeled to show their intended use, e.g., “Patty Mix” or “Gravy Mix.” The labels of the mixtures must show the ingredients in order of their predominance. MOCK DRUMSTICKS: An imitation product; nonspecific. MOCK TURTLE SOUP: Product must contain at least 10 percent beef and may be made with beef and beef byproducts. MOFONGO: Pork skins and plantain type product with at least 20 percent pork skins in the total formulation.

This does not apply to products containing more than 3.5 percent binders or 2 percent isolated soy protein. MONDONGO: A mixture of one or more of the following: (a) beef tripe, (b) cattle feet with or without hide on, (c) chitterlings, and (d) beef intestines. See: Beef Tripe Stew MORCELLA BLOOD PUDDING: Nonspecific. The product is made from pork fat, beef blood and/or pork blood, and may contain meat. MORTADELLA: Normally a cooked sausage but can be dry or semi-dry. It is similar to salami and cervelat except that it has large chunks of pork fat. Red sweet peppers up to 4 percent and pistachio nuts up to 1 percent are acceptable as long as they are shown in the true product name. MORTADELLA (CANNED): Canned items designated “Mortadella” must be labeled with the phrase “Perishable, Keep Under Refrigeration” and must have an MPR of 3.85:1 or less. See: Manual 18.46', 'MORTADELLA -POULTRY: Poultry Mortadella is a dry, semi-dry, or cooked sausage formulated with poultry. The sausage must contain large chunks of pork fat and may contain extenders and/or binders. Red sweet peppers are permitted up to 4 percent and pistachio nuts up to 1 percent and shown as added in the true product name. See: Policy Memo 029 If product is canned, the MPR must not exceed 3.85:1, the internal temperature must have reached 160o F and the product labeled “Perishable, Keep Under Refrigeration” or similar wording. MORTADELLA WITHOUT FAT CUBES OR CHUNKS: Product must meet the standard for Mortadella and the label be qualified to indicate the absence of Fat Cubes or Chunks, e.g., “Mortadella without Fat Cubes” or “Mortadella without Fat Chunks.” MOUSAKA, MOUSSAKA, MUSAKA (GK): Must contain at least 25 percent meat. Mousaka is a casserole containing layers of meat and eggplant made in various ways throughout the Middle East. A true product name is required, e.g., “Eggplant and Meat Casserole.” MULLICATAWNY SOUP: Product must contain at least 2 percent cooked poultry meat and enough curry powder and pepper to characterize the product. The label must show a true product name, e.g., “Chicken Mullicatawny Soup.” MULLIGAN STEW: Product must contain at least 25 percent fresh meat or meat and poultry. Mulligan stew is a mixture of vegetables and meat combined in a gravy or sauce. The label must have a true product name, e.g., “Chicken and Meat Mulligan Stew.” MUSTARD BRAN: This is not considered a spice and must be declared as “Mustard Bran.” It is not acceptable in sausage. MUSTARD FLOUR: It is a spice that is commonly used in sausage products.', ""MYVACET: (Distilled Acetylated Monoglycerides). Acceptable for use as a coating on sausage casings. Sausages coated with Myvacet shall show, adjacent to the product name, a qualifying statement disclosing the presence of the compound, e.g., “Summer Sausage Coated with a Solution of Distilled Acetylated Monoglycerides.” NACHO STYLE, NACHO FLAVOR, AND SIMILAR TERMS: Acceptable terminology for products possessing the commonly expected flavor characteristics associated with “Nachos,” a Mexican hors d'oeurve. The characterizing flavor components generally include, but are not limited to, cheese (Cheddar or Monterey Jack), tomato (tomato solids, tomato powder), spices, or other natural seasonings and flavorings (usually garlic and onion), and chili peppers (mild or hot). Romano and Parmesan cheese are also often present. However, these cheeses may not be used to satisfy the above cheese requirement. NATURAL CLAIMS: The term “natural” may be used on labeling for meat products and poultry products, provided the applicant for such labeling demonstrates that: (1) the product does not contain any artificial flavor or flavoring, coloring ingredient, or chemical preservative (as defined in 21 CFR 101.22), or any other artificial or synthetic ingredient; and (2) the product and its ingredients are not more than minimally processed. Minimal processing may include: (a) those traditional processes used to make food edible or to preserve it or to make it safe for human consumption, e.g., smoking, roasting, freezing, drying, and fermenting, or (b) those physical processes which do not fundamentally alter the raw product and/or which only separate a whole, intact food into component parts, e.g., grinding meat, separating eggs into albumen and yolk, and pressing fruits to produce juices. Relatively severe processes, e.g., solvent extraction, acid hydrolysis, and chemical bleaching would clearly be considered more than minimal processing. Thus, the use of a natural flavor or flavoring in compliance with 21 CFR 101.22 which has undergone more than minimal processing would place a product in which it is used outside the scope of these guidelines. However, the presence of an ingredient which has been more than minimally processed would not necessarily preclude the product from being promoted as natural. Exceptions of this type may be granted on a case-by-case basis if it can be demonstrated that the use of such an ingredient would not significantly change the character of the product to the point that it could no longer be considered a natural product. In such cases, the natural claim must be qualified to clearly and conspicuously identify the ingredient, e.g., .all natural or all natural ingredients except dextrose, modified food starch, etc.”"", 'All products claiming to be natural or a natural food should be accompanied by a brief statement which explains what is meant by the term natural, i.e., that the product is a natural food because it contains no artificial ingredients and is only minimally processed. This statement should appear directly beneath or beside all natural claims or, if elsewhere on the principal display panel; an asterisk should be used to tie the explanation to the claim. The decision to approve or deny the use of a natural claim may be affected by the specific context in which the claim is made. For example, claims indicating that a product is natural food, e.g., “Natural chili” or “chili -a natural product” would be unacceptable for a product containing beet powder which artificially colors the finished product. However, “all natural ingredients” might be an acceptable claim for such a product. Correction: In the August 2005 edition of the Policy Book, a “Note” was added to the entry on “natural claims” indicating that “Sugar, sodium lactate (from a corn source), and natural flavorings from oleoresins or extractives are acceptable for “all natural” claims. The Note was followed by other new text that stated “This entry cancels Policy Memo 055 dated November 22, 1982. See: 7 CFR NOP Final Report, Part 205.601 through 205.606 for acceptable ingredients allowed for all natural claims.” This “Note” is now revised to read as follows: Note: Sugar and natural flavorings from oleoresins or extractives are acceptable for “all natural” claims. The other text, including the reference to “sodium lactate (from a corn source)” has been removed from the guidance on “natural claims” for the reasons explained below. The note regarding sodium lactate (from a corn source) was added to the “natural” entry in recognition that manufacturers could show that the ingredient was from a natural source (i.e., from corn), was no more than minimally processed, and provided a flavoring effect, not an antimicrobial effect, at levels consistent with those regulated for the purpose of flavoring (i.e., less than 2 percent of a formulation). Thus, the Agency considered such uses to be consistent with the meaning of “natural.” However, recent information provided to FSIS raises questions about this judgment. This information indicates that sodium lactate, potassium lactate, and calcium lactate provide an antimicrobial effect at levels that have been regulated as providing a flavoring effect. Therefore, regardless of whether it can be shown that any form of lactate is from a natural source and is not more than minimally processed, the use of lactate (sodium, potassium, and calcium) may conflict with the meaning of “natural” because it may be having a preservative effect at levels of use associated with flavoring. Thus, listing “sodium lactate (from a corn source)” in the previous entry may have been in error, at least without qualifying the listing by stating that the use of this ingredient or any ingredient known to have multiple technical effects needs to be judged on a case-by-case basis at the time of label approval to assess that the intended use, level of use, and technical function are consistent with the 1982 policy. Whether there should ever be a blanket acceptance of any ingredient that has multiple functions, including an antimicrobial or preservative function, in products labeled “natural” is a complicated issue that is best addressed through notice and', 'comment rulemaking. Therefore, FSIS has removed the reference to sodium lactate from this guidance but will judge claims that foods to which a lactate has been added can be characterized as “natural” on a case-by-case basis, pending the outcome of a rulemaking on the use of “natural” that the Agency intends to initiate in the near future. This correction also removes the statement in the entry on “Natural Claims,” “See: 7 CFR NOP Final Report, Part 205.601 through 205.606 for acceptable ingredients allowed for all natural claims.” This statement was intended to help manufacturers locate a source to support the claims that ingredients they use in “natural” products are not more than minimally processed, are not artificial or synthetic, and do not act to preserve products. The Agency has removed this text because it was confusing users of the policy guidance who thought that any ingredient that is “organic” could be used in a “natural” product, which is not the case. NATURAL SMOKED COLOR: Approval can be properly granted to labels with this statement when the products involved are “Smoked” and not artificially colored. The results of the use of artificial smoke materials can, by means of a number of processing operations, result in a color characteristic being acquired by the frankfurters, bologna, and the like. The term “Natural Smoked Color” can be used to properly identify this point. NAVARIN: Navarin is a stew containing lamb or mutton and vegetables and considered a national dish of France. It must meet the meat stew standard of 25 percent meat. Show true product name, e.g., “Navarin-Lamb Stew.” NEGATIVE LABELING: (1) Negative labeling is allowed if it is unclear from the product name that the ingredient is not present. For example, the use of the term “no beef” on the label of “turkey pastrami” would further clarify that the product does not contain beef. (2) Negative labeling is allowed if the statement is beneficial for health, religious preference, or other similar reasons. For example, highlighting the absence of salt in a product would be helpful to those persons on sodium-restricted diets. (3) Negative labeling is allowed if the claims are directly linked to the product packaging, as opposed to the product itself. For example, flexible retortable pouches could bear the statement “no preservatives, refrigeration or freezing needed with this new packaging method.” (4) Negative labeling is allowed if such claims call attention to the absence of ingredients because they are prohibited in a product by regulation or policy. The statement must clearly and prominently indicate this fact, so as not to mislead or', 'create false impressions. For example, “USDA regulations prohibit the use of preservatives in this product” would be an acceptable statement for ground beef. (5) Negative labeling is allowed to indicate that absence of an ingredient when that ingredient is expected or permitted by regulation or policy. This could also apply to ingredients which are not expected or permitted by regulation or policy if the ingredients could find their way into the product through a component. For example, the use of “no preservatives” on the label of “spaghetti with meat and sauce” (where regulations do not permit the direct addition of preservatives) would be acceptable if the product contained an ingredient, such as cooking oil, which could contain antioxidants but do not. These guidelines do not preempt the requirements of the nutrition labeling regulation. Therefore, negative claims such as “unsalted” would have to comply with the provisions stated in the nutrition labeling regulations. See Policy Memo 019B dated August 18, 1994 NET QUANTITY OF CONTENTS ON COMBINATION PACKAGES: The guidelines for stating the net quantity of contents on combination packages containing both liquid and solid products are as follows: 1. The declaration of net quantity of contents for a combination package shall be expressed in terms of fluid measure for individual products that are liquid and in terms of avoirdupois weight for individual products that are solid, semisolid, or viscous, provided the quantity statements for identical packages or units are combined. For example, the fruit drink would be expressed in fluid measure and the meat, cheese, crackers, and cookies would be expressed in the combined avoirdupois weight. 2. The declaration of quantity shall be preceded by one of the following terms, as appropriate: “Net Weight,” “Net Wt.,” or “Net Contents.” The net quantity of contents declaration may appear in more than one line. Therefore, both stacked and side-by-side declarations would be considered appropriate. -Descriptive terms may be used to identify the liquid and solid components of the package, e.g., entree, meal, or drink; however, such terms shall not include brand names. -Connecting words such as “and” or “plus” are permitted to be used as part of the declaration of contents. Examples of acceptable net content declarations are as follows: (1) Entree Net Wt. 8 oz., Drink 4 fl. oz. (120ml)', '(2) Net Contents: lunch 8 oz. plus fruit drink 4 fl. oz. (3) Net Wt. 8 oz. Drink 4 fl. oz. (120ml) (4) Net Weight 8 oz. and 4 fl. oz. Federally inspected meat and poultry products are exempt from the requirements of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA), including the mandatory metric labeling provisions that went into effect February 14, 1994. However, if metric labeling is included voluntarily, such labeling should comply with the FPLA. The guidelines contained in this policy memo will be subject to the provisions prescribed in 9 CFR 317.2(h) and 9 CFR 381.121 of the Federal regulations. See: Policy Memo 124 dated January 17, 1995 NET WEIGHT STATEMENT: Divider Pak: On a product where two cans are taped together, one of which contains the meat or poultry item and the other a vegetable, e.g., “Chicken Chow Mein,” the meat or poultry label may include the net weight on the 20 percent panel. The vegetable can bears the true name of the product with the total net weight of the other can and the drained weight of the vegetable can. Double Packing: When a poultry product and a non-poultry product are separately wrapped and placed in a single immediate container bearing the name of both products, the net weight shown on the immediate container may be the total net weight of the two products or the net weight of the poultry product and the non-poultry product separately. Additional Net Weight Information: Nonregulatory information of a net weight nature, e.g., 4-3 oz. packages, accompanying a net weight statement is acceptable and need not adhere to the size and spacing restrictions. Open Net Weights: Open net weights may be presented in pounds and ounces, decimals, decimal fractions, or fractions, e.g., 1 1/2 lbs., 1.6 lbs. Net Weight Requirements: The statement of net quantity of contents is required on all products intended for sale at retail intact. In addition, shipping containers must bear a net quantity of contents statement if product inside is not uniform in weight (i.e., random weight). Piece counts may not be used in lieu of a required net quantity of contents statement on a shipping container but may be used as additional information. Multi-Unit Retail Packages: Fully labeled packages of more than one of the same meat or poultry product packages in an open (i.e., clear) overwrap do not have to include a net weight statement.', 'See: 9 CFR 317.2(h), and 9 CFR 381.121(b) MPI Bulletin 211 NET WEIGHT STATEMENTS ON PACKAGES WITH HEADER LABELS: The guidelines for determining the size and location of net weight statements on meat food product packages with header labels are as follows: 1. The entire front of the package is considered the principal display panel of the package and its area is used to determine the size of the net weight statement. Print size specifications for the net weight statement specified by the regulations must be followed. 2. The net weight statement should be placed within the lower 30 percent area of the header label if no other mandatory labeling features are printed on the rest of the principal display panel of the package. If mandatory features do appear below the header label, the net weight statement must be placed within the lower 30 percent of the total area containing any mandatory information. A “Header Label” is a small label applied across the top of a package usually bearing all of the mandatory labeling information. The rest of the package is most often a clear film containing a meat or poultry product, e.g., luncheon meat. This type of packaging is designed to be used on pegboard type displays. See: Policy Memo 047 dated May 3, 1982 “NEW” AND SIMILAR TERMS: Terms like “new,” “now,” “improved,” and similar terms may be used within the following guidelines: 1. The terms may only be used for a period of 6 months from the date of the initial approval, except as noted in 2., 3., and 4. below. 2. Extensions to the 6-month period may be granted if: a. Processors can demonstrate that production or distribution delays precluded the use of the approved labeling as scheduled. In such situations, the lost time can be restored. b. Processors can demonstrate that labeling inventory needs for the 6-month period were over estimated due to poor sales. The processors must maintain records which indicate the amount and the date the labeling was originally purchased. In this situation, up to an additional 6 months can be granted. No further extension will be considered.', '3. In those situations where it is customary to distribute “new” products to various geographical regions, each geographic area may receive a sketch approval for 6 months if the processor can assure adequate controls over the segregation and distribution of the products. 4. In situations where it is customary to test market product in no more than approximately 15 percent of the intended total marketing area before total distribution begins, labeling for the test market area can receive a sketch approval and also be included in the 6-month sketch approval given to the labeling of the product distributed to the total marketing area. Processors must be able to assure that only 15 percent of the total market is involved in test marketing. See: Policy Memo 107 dated August 18, 1987 NEW ENGLAND BOILED DINNER: Product must contain at least 25 percent cooked “Corned Beef.” NEW ORLEANS STYLE: Acceptable for products that contain any five of the following ingredients: Roux base, rice, onion, green onions garlic, celery, bell peppers, cayenne pepper, white pepper, parsley, or tomato. The product may contain various protein sources including seafood and game. NITRITE: Calculations should be based on the total meat block including the muscle tissue, fat and blood (e.g., “Blood Pudding”). If the product is cured, the blood would be included and considered part of the meat. NON-AMENABLE PRODUCT/VOLUNTARY INSPECTION: [Examples of non-amenable products are sandwiches containing meat or poultry, clam chowder which has less than 1 percent bacon for export to Japan, and natural casings for export]. Any non-amenable product can be produced under voluntary inspection when requested (9 CFR 318.13 and Subchapter B, Part 350.3(c)). However, most FSIS requirements have to be met concerning labeling, i.e., mandatory labeling features, an accurate ingredients statement, handling statement, etc. Safe Handling Instructions are not required even for raw non-amenable products. FDA nutrition labeling rules apply to such products.', 'NON-DAIRY WHITE SAUCE OR NON-DAIRY SAUCE: A sauce made with a non-dairy creamer. If this type of a sauce is proposed for use with “Chipped Beef,” a suitable name would be “Non-Dairy White Sauce with Chipped Beef” or “Non-Dairy Sauce with Chipped Beef.” The reference to “Cream” or any of its derivations should not appear in the product name. NONSPECIFIC MEAT FOOD PRODUCTS: Red meat items of this type do not have specific requirements, i.e., they do not possess a standard of identity or composition. Consequently, these products shall be identified by one of two ways: (1) A descriptive name that identifies characterizing components and/or ingredients, or (2) a fanciful or coined name that is accompanied by an ingredients statement. The latter approach should be used when the use of a descriptive name is not practical, e.g., when the descriptive name would read like an ingredients statement. When a fanciful name or coined name is used, the ingredients statement should appear contiguous to the product name on the principal display panel of an immediate container. NONSTANDARDIZED COOKED SAUSAGE PRODUCTS CONTAINING BOTH LIVESTOCK AND POULTRY INGREDIENTS: The labeling of nonstandardized cooked sausage products must comply with 9 CFR 319.180. Meat food products are those in which more than 50 percent of the livestock and poultry product portion consists of livestock ingredients. Such cooked sausage products which contain poultry ingredients at more than 15 percent of the total ingredients (excluding water) must have product names that indicate the species of livestock and kind(s) of poultry ingredients, e.g., “Beef and Turkey Frankfurter” or “Frankfurter Made From Beef and Turkey.” Poultry food products are those in which more than 50 percent of the livestock and poultry products portion consists of poultry. Livestock ingredients at more than 20 percent of the total poultry and livestock ingredients must have product names that indicate the kind(s) of poultry and species of livestock ingredients, e.g., “Turkey and Beef Frankfurter” or “Frankfurter Made From Turkey and Beef.” Such cooked sausage products which contain livestock ingredients at 20 percent or less of the total poultry and livestock ingredients must have product names that are appropriately qualified to indicate the inclusion of livestock ingredients, e.g., “Turkey Frankfurter -Pork Added or Turkey Frankfurter -With Pork. ” (The product names of cooked sausage products which contain no livestock ingredients designate the kind(s) of poultry ingredients, e.g., “Turkey Frankfurter.”) Cooked sausage products containing over 50 percent meat ingredients would carry the red meat legend while those containing over 50 percent poultry ingredients would carry the poultry legend.', 'See: Policy Memo 087A regarding word size in the labeling of product names. See: Policy Memo 005A dated November 25, 1987 NOODLE CHICKEN VEGETABLE DINNER OR NOODLE CHICKEN DINNER WITH VEGETABLES: (Canned or in glass jars). Product must contain at least 6 percent cooked chicken. NUGGET LABELING: Nuggets are irregularly shaped, usually bite-sized meat and/or poultry products which are usually breaded and deep fat fried and intended to be used as finger foods. There are a number of different types of nuggets, the labeling for which is: (1) Products made from a solid piece of meat or poultry may use the term “Nugget” as part of the product name without further qualification (e.g., “Chicken Nugget,” “Beef Nugget”). (2) Products made from chopped and formed meat or poultry may use the term “Nugget” as part of the product name, provided a qualifying statement describing such process is shown contiguous to the product name (e.g., “Chicken Nugget, Chopped and Formed” or “Beef Nugget, Chopped and Formed”). (3) Products made from chopped meat or poultry and containing binders, extenders and/or water may use the term “Nugget” as a fanciful name, provided a descriptive name immediately follows “Species” or “Kind” nugget (e.g., “Breaded Nugget-Shaped Chicken Patties”). (4) Products described in (1), (2), and (3) above which are breaded shall be labeled as “breaded” and shall be limited to 30 percent breading. See: Policy Memo 088 dated May 23, 1985 OAT FIBER: “Oat fiber,” should be identified in the ingredients statement as “isolated oat product.” It may be used in non-standardized products and in products, such as, “taco fillings.” OLEOMARGARINE: The Establishment Number may be omitted from the outer container, provided that articles are completely labeled including Establishment Number inside. See: 9 CFR 317.2(i)', 'OMELET, DENVER OR WESTERN STYLE: Product must contain at least 18 percent ham with onions and green and/or red peppers. OMELET, FLORENTINE: Product must contain at least 9 percent cooked meat and must contain spinach. OMELETS WITH: Bacon -must contain at least 9 percent cooked bacon Chicken Livers -must contain at least 12 percent cooked liver Corned Beef Hash -must contain at least 25 percent corned beef hash Creamed Beef -must contain at least 25 percent creamed beef Ham -must contain at least 18 percent cooked ham Sausage -must contain at least 12 percent dry sausage Sausage and Cheese, (omelet with pepperoni, cheese and sauce) -must contain at least 9 percent sausage in the total product. OPEN DATING: Labels showing further qualifying phrases in addition to the explanatory phrase must submit with the application sufficient documentation to support these additional claims. See (9 CFR 317.8(b)(32) and 9 CFR 381.129(c).) Some local authorities require that packaged foods heated and sold hot from industrial catering vehicles be dated with the day the foods were placed in the warming units (e.g., Tuesday, Friday, etc.). When assured by the local authorities that the foods are under a rigid local inspection program, the designations may be approved without an explanatory statement as required by the regulations. To date, only the county of Los Angeles, California, has provided this assurance. The packing date should be shown on immediate or shipping containers of poultry food products as required by regulations (9 CFR 381.126 and 381.129(c)). When meat or poultry products are packed and held in freezer storage for later repacking, the explanatory phrase on repacked product should be in terms of “sell by” or “use before.” However, if a “packed on” phrase is desired, the date shown shall be that of the original packing of the product.', 'OSTRICH AND OTHER RATITES (EMU): Products that do not contain 3 percent of beef, pork, chicken or turkey, can not contain cure ingredients, i.e., Nitrite, nitrate. PAELLA CON BACALAO (SP): Product must contain at least 35 percent cooked meat or poultry meat and include seafood and no more than 25 percent cooked rice. The label must show true product name, e.g., “Beef and Fish with Rice.” PAPAIN: Meat and poultry products that are dipped in a solution containing papain are require to show in conjunction with the product name a statement, for example, “Tenderized with a solution of (list ingredients of solution).” Carcasses of animals treated with papain by antemortem injection are required to be roller branded “Tenderized with Papain.” Parts not so marked are required to be labeled as “Tenderized with Papain.” See: 9 CFR 317.8(b) (25) 9 CFR 381.120 9 CFR 424.21 Enzymes-Proteolytic PAPRIKA: Generally, paprika and/or oleoresin of paprika are not permitted in or on fresh red meat products, fresh ground poultry, or fresh poultry sausage. They are permitted under the following conditions: 1. In both red meat and poultry products where such ingredients are acceptable and expected, including Italian Sausage, Salisica, Chorizo, Longaniza, and Hungarian Style products. All requests for additional products should be referred to the Labeling and Consumer Protection Staff to determine their acceptability. 2. On red meat products where their use does not misrepresent the leanness or freshness, e.g., application to a surface layer of fat and not to the muscle tissue. However, the name must be appropriately qualified, e.g., “coated with paprika” or “artificially colored.” 3. In or on products where they are expected and the product name discloses this fact, or the product name refers to a component expected to contain the ingredients. Examples include: “Beef with Barbecue Sauce,” “Beef -Barbecue Flavor,” “Chicken Paprikash,” “Chicken with Orange Sauce,” or similar type products.', '4. In fresh whole muscle poultry products, provided their presence is properly described, e.g., “coated with paprika,” or “artificially colored,” as appropriate. PARTIALLY COOKED: 1. Partially cooked bacon – acceptable nomenclature if shrink requirement for fully cooked bacon is not met must meet requirements for trichinae treatment. Cooking instructions are required. 2. Partially cooked poultry – unacceptable for cooked poultry products. PARTIALLY DEFATTED (BEEF OR PORK) FATTY TISSUE: These are byproducts produced from fatty trimmings containing less than 12 percent lean meat. These ingredients may be used in meat products in which byproducts are acceptable. Products include nonspecific loaves, beef patties, frankfurters with byproducts, bologna with variety meats, imitation sausage, potted meat food product, sauces, or gravies. May be used in excess of the amounts of meat necessary to satisfy the standard for only the products listed in the Policy Book. However, in this situation, the PDCB or PDCP must always be declared in the ingredients statement. See: 9 CFR 319.15(e) 9 CFR 319.29(a) PARTIALLY DEFATTED CHOPPED (Beef or Pork) (PDCB, PDCP): 1. Partially Defatted Chopped Beef is not permitted in hamburger, ground or chopped beef. The School Lunch Program requires that when PDCB is used in products like taco mix, which later may be used in preparing other products (e.g., tacos or patties), the PDCB or PDCP must always be declared in the ingredients statement on the labeling of the taco mix. All Beef or 100 percent Beef is acceptable as product name. 2. Partially Defatted Chopped may be used in excess of meat necessary to satisfy the standards on only the products listed in the Policy Book. However, in this situation, the PDCP must always be declared in the ingredients statement.

The policy does not apply to raw meat or poultry, cooked or roast beef, cooked poultry rolls and similar products, whole or uncut cured products, or products that are distributed and marketed frozen. However, products containing cured meat or poultry as components in combination with raw vegetables, e.g., pasta salads and other chilled meat/poultry meals or entrees containing raw or partially cooked vegetables, are covered under this policy, provided the above-mentioned procedural attributes are indicative of the manufacturing process. In addition, an approved partial quality control program (PQCP) is required which must address the critical points in the manufacturing process. As such, the PQCP must contain a detailed description of: ingredient storage controls, product formulation and preparation, container filling and sealing, any heat treatment (times/temperatures) applied, including a description of the equipment used, any other treatments applied, cooling procedures (times/temperatures), lot identification procedures; finished product storage conditions, in plant quality control procedures, and records maintenance procedures. The PQCP must be forwarded to the Processed Products Inspection Division (PPID) for appropriate review and approval before the product label may be used. Guidelines for development of PQCP's for these products may be obtained from PPID upon request. See: Policy Memo 110 dated December 8, 1987 PET FOOD: 1. Certified pet food is manufactured under fee-for-service inspection in a facility approved for the manufacture of animal food. Labeling regulations for certified animal food specify that approval is granted by the labeling staff. However, final approvals are not granted since LCPS no longer grants final approvals. Rather, the company should keep a copy of the final label attached to the sketch approval."", '2. Most food for animal consumption produced in a Federal facility is non-certified. It is not an inspected product; therefore, it is inedible product and does not bear any mark of inspection. The product has to be conspicuously labeled to distinguish it from human food. Additionally, the labeling must be in conformance with 21 CFR Part 501, Animal Food Labeling since animal food labeling is also under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration. PFEFFERWURST (GR): Product should conform to sausage standard and contain whole peppercorn. Pork livers, pork stock, and beef blood are not acceptable ingredients. PHOSPHATED TRIMMINGS IN LOAVES: Trimmings from preparation of pork cuts, cured with approved phosphates besides other curing ingredients, may be used without limitation in loaves other than meat loaves.

A Russian or Jewish dish made of thin rolled dough or pastry that is filled and either steamed, baked, or fried. They resemble small turnovers, pockets, or raviolis. PIZZA: Products identified as “pizzas” that contain a meat or poultry component as part of the product name are no longer required to contain a minimum amount of meat or poultry provided that the meat component is sufficient to make the product subject to USDA jurisdiction. An antioxidant used in pepperoni or sausage need only be reflected in the ingredients statement. See: 9 CFR 317.8(b)(40) and 9 CFR 381.129(f) PIZZA BURGER: Product meets the burger standard, e.g., hamburger or ground beef patty. It can be two patties with cheese (usually Romano) and/or tomato or pizza sauce between the patties. PIZZA, CHICAGO STYLE: Acceptable labeling for a product which has been manufactured by first placing the cheese on the crust, then following with the meat and then the sauce. Condimental quantities of a grated cheese may then be placed on the top. The product usually has the deep dish characteristics.', 'PIZZA CONTAINING CHEESE SUBSTITUTES: The labels for products containing cheese in a ratio less than one part cheese to nine parts cheese substitute, need to include additional qualifying information. Example: Pizza Sausage, cheese substitute and cheese; Combination Pizza -Sausage -Pepperoni Imitation Cheese and Cheese. See: Policy Memo 01 dated May 6, 1980 PIZZA DOGS: A nonspecific product. PIZZA, PAN STYLE: Pizza that is marketed in a pan and contains a thick crust. PIZZA PUPS: Product has two crusts, filled with a mixture of pork, tomato puree, and condimental substances.

The formulation must indicate the sausage portion of the pizza topping. However, the ingredients statement of the cooked pizza topping does not have to list “sausage” in its sublisting. There are no restrictions on the amount of seasonings in the sausage portion. 1. Pizza topping must be cooked. 2. In the sausage portion: a. Water ≤ (less than or equal to) 10 percent of the sausage portion b. Binders including TVP ≤ (less than or equal to) 3.5 percent of the sausage portion c. Seasonings are unlimited 3. The ingredients statement of the pizza topping can be arranged in different ways: a. Composite e.g., cooked pizza topping [pork, water, TVP (…), Seasonings (…)] b. Component, e.g., cooked pizza topping [sausage (pork, water, seasonings (…), TVP (…), water (…)] These parameters do not apply when specific sausage products are subject to other regulations, e.g., Italian Sausage. In these situations, the specific regulation (i.e., Italian Sausage) provides the requirements, such as, the amount of water and binders are permitted. PIZZA TOPPING MIX: A nonspecific product, which includes products with names that indicate the type of meat or poultry in the product (e.g., Chicken and Pork Pizza Topping or Beef Pizza Topping). Antioxidants are permitted, see 9 CFR 424.21. Water, extenders, and binders are acceptable. PIZZA, WORD SIZE: When a pizza has a true product name, e.g., “Combination Sausage and Pepperoni Pizza,” the true product name must be prominent, conspicuous, and legible, with all words at least one-third the size of the largest letter in any word of the product name. If on the label the manufacturer also elects to display elsewhere the word “Pizza” in exaggerated fashion, the word “Pizza” is not considered in the determination of the size of the letters within the true product name. See: Policy Memo 087A dated September 16, 1985', 'PFF (PROTEIN FAT FREE) ADJUSTING FOR USE: Protein Fat Free (PFF) controlled cured pork products with qualifying statements, e.g., “Ham-Water Added,” may be used in place of PFF controlled cured pork products without qualifying statements, e.g., Ham, to meet the minimum meat requirements of various products. However, the amounts of the PFF controlled cured pork products with qualifying statements used will need to be increased. For example, if a standard requires a certain amount of Ham and a processor wishes to use “Ham-Water Added,” a greater amount of the “Ham-Water Added” will be needed to meet the standard. The magnitude of the additional amount is directly related to the relationship between the respective PFF values. See: Policy Memo 093 dated December 16, 1985 Example: Ham Salad requires 35 percent Cooked Ham. “Ham Water Added” will be used in the product formula. Calculation: Multiply the PFF value for Ham (20.5) by the amount of required Ham (35 percent). Divide this answer by the PFF value of the product being used to formulate the product. (In this example, PFF value for “Ham-Water Added” is 17.0.) Answer: [(0.35 x 20.5) / 17.0] x 100 = 42.21 percent “Ham-Water Added” needed in the formula. Example: Ham Pie requires 25 percent Ham based on green weight. “Ham with Natural Juices” will be used in the product formula. Calculation: Multiply the PFF value for Ham (20.5) by the amount of required ham (25 percent). Divide this answer by the PFF value of the product being used to formulate the product. (In this example, PFF value for “Ham with Natural Juices” is 18.5.) Answer: [(0.25 x 20.5) / 18.5] x 100 = 27.70 percent “Ham with Natural Juices” needed in the formula. ADJUSTING FOR “HAM AND WATER PRODUCT X percent OF THE WEIGHT IS ADDED INGREDIENTS.” Consider a formulated product which is required to contain at least 50 percent Cooked Ham. If the processor chooses to use a “Ham and Water Product (HWP)” in which 20 percent of the weight is added ingredients as the source of the Ham in the formulation, this product contains 80 percent Ham and 20 percent added ingredients. Clearly, the processor must use more than 50 percent HWP in the process. Using 50 percent HWP would result in only 40 percent Ham in the finished product, i.e., the added ingredients in the HWP represents 25 percent of the ham content. (If it were a 10 lb. HWP, there would be 8 lbs. of Ham and 2 lbs. of added ingredients. (2 / 8 x 100 = 25 percent). Consequently, an additional 25 percent of HWP is required in the formulation. The following example may be used to determine the percentage HWP needed to equal', 'Ham: Ham and Gravy requires 50 percent Cooked Ham. “Ham and Water Product 20 percent of Weight is Added Ingredients” will be used in the formulation. Step 1: Subtract the percent added ingredients from 100 percent. In this example: 1.00 -0.20 = 0.80) Step 2: Determine the amount of Ham needed in the formula. (In this example: 50 percent) Step 3: Divide the amount of Ham required. Determined in Step 2) by the answer in Step 1 (In this example: (0.50 / 0.80 = 0.625) Step 4: Multiply the answer in Step 3 by 100. Answer for this example is 62.50 percent “Ham and 20 percent Water Product” is needed as the equivalent of 50 percent Ham. PLANTATION: The regulations and policies applicable to “Farm” also apply to plantation. POINT OF PURCHASE MATERIALS: Point of purchase materials which refer to specific meat or poultry products are considered labeling under certain circumstances. When printed and/or graphic informational materials (e.g., pamphlets, brochures, posters, etc.) accompany or are applied to products or any of their containers or wrappers at the point of purchase, such materials and the claims that they bear are deemed labeling and they are subject to the provisions of the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act. Although the Food Labeling Division (FLD) does not exercise its authority to subject point of purchase materials to specific prior approval (materials shipped with the products from the federally inspected establishment are an exception), we do expect point of purchase materials to be in accordance with the Federal regulations and all current labeling policies. Upon request, FLD will review and comment on the point of purchase materials submitted to our office. During the review process, promotional materials will be scrutinized for special claims, particularly those related to nutrition, diet, and animal husbandry practices. Claims related to nutrition and diet must be made in accordance with all current nutrition labeling regulations. Continuing compliance with stated claims will be assured through periodic sampling, as necessary. Claims are expected to be within the compliance parameters identified in the nutrition labeling regulations. Animal husbandry claims (e.g., the nonuse of antibiotics or growth stimulants) may be made only for products shipped in containers or wrappers labeled with the same animal production claims. See: Policy Memo 114A dated August 18, 1994', 'POLISH SAUSAGE: A sausage that is cured, cooked, and usually smoked. Pork and pork byproducts shall comprise at least 50 percent of the meat and meat byproducts ingredients. To have beef as a predominant ingredient, the product name would be “Beef and Pork Polish Sausage.” Green peppers are permitted up to 4 percent in total formulation. An uncured (fresh), uncooked variety with no more than 3 percent water also exists. “Fresh” shall be used in the name when the product is uncured. When Fresh Polish Sausage is cooked or smoked, then the product name is either “Cooked Fresh Polish Sausage” or “Smoked Fresh Polish Sausage.” The requirements of Policy Memo 110 apply when these perishable, cooked, uncured products are packaged in hermetically sealed containers. POLYNESIAN STYLE SAUSAGE: Product must contain fruit juices, a sweetening agent, and soy sauce. POLYSORBATE: Permitted in pickling solutions without declaration. PORK AND BACON SAUSAGE: Up to 50 percent bacon permitted provided: 1. bacon is brought back to green weight before use. 2. product is trichinae treated. 3. product name is “Pork and Bacon Sausage.” The standard for “Pork Sausage and/with Bacon” is 10 to 20 percent bacon, and for “Pork and Bacon Sausage” is more than 20 percent but not more than 50 percent bacon. PORK AND DRESSING: Product must contain at least 50 percent cooked pork. PORK AND DRESSING WITH GRAVY: Product must contain at least 30 percent pork. PORK CRACKLINGS: Product eligible to be labeled as “Pork Cracklings” must be prepared from fatty tissues from which the skin has been detached. If the skin is not removed from the product before rendering, a descriptive name, e.g., “Pork Cracklings, Fried-Out Pork Fat with Attached Skin,” must be used.', 'PORK FAT: Pork fat shall be declared as such in the ingredients statement. Clear fatbacks and clear shoulder plates must be declared as “Pork Fat.” Pork fat may be declared as pork in the ingredients statement if it contains visible lean and it is used in a standardized product which has a fat limitation. PORK JOWLS: Product may be declared as pork if skinned. See: Pork Skins PORK SAUSAGE: Product identified as pork sausage does not include the use of pork cheeks. When such an item is offered as “Whole Hog,” tongues, hearts, and cheeks may be used in the natural proportion as found in the hog carcass. “Fresh” shall be used in the name when the product is not cured, cooked and/or smoked. PORK SKIN RESIDUE AFTER GELATIN EXTRACTION: This material consists of back fat skins from which the gelatin has been extracted by means of soaking the skin in acid and subsequent low temperature cooking for the extraction of gelatin. It is not permitted in sausage but may be used in imitation sausage, potted meat food product, loaves (other than meat loaves), and other nonspecific products. PORK SKINS: Not permitted in salami, bologna, frankfurters, Vienna sausage, and braunschweiger. When packed in vinegar pickle, they are not permitted to be artificially colored. When pork skin, either attached to fat and/or muscle tissue or detached from fat and/or muscle tissue, is used to manufacture meat or poultry products, it must be specifically listed in the formulation on the label approval application form and in the ingredients statement on the label, e.g., “Pork Skins,” Unskinned Pork Jowls,” “Unskinned Pork Shoulder Trimming,” “Unskinned Pork Fat,” and “Unskinned Pork Bellies.” “Detached skin” refers to the portion of skin from which most of the underlying fat is removed, e.g., skin from bacon intended for slicing, skin from closely skinned hams, shoulder cuts, fat backs, etc. If removal of skin portions is incidental to removal of a considerable proportion of underlying fat from ham, shoulder, back, etc., preparatory to rendering such fat, portions of skin so removed should not be regarded as detached skin and may be included with fats and rendered into lard. Ham facings are not regarded as detached skin.', 'PORK SKINS, FRIED: When prepared from the skin of smoked pork bellies, it may be labeled as “Fried Bacon Skins,” “Fried Bacon Rinds,” or “Fried Pork Skins.” The kind of skin used must be stated on the labeling records when submitted for label approvals. PORK SPARE RIBS, CENTER CUT: Center cut pork spare ribs refers to pork spare ribs with the loin portion, the brisket (brisket must be removed at a point which is dorsal to the curvature of the costal cartilages), the tail and two ribs from the shoulder removed, this remaining center section may be further portioned or left in one piece. PORK SPARERIBS, ST. LOUIS STYLE: St. Louis Style Spare Ribs are the same as “Pork Spareribs” except that the sternum and the ventral portion of the costal cartilages are removed with the flank portion. This cut is made at a point in which the sternum and costal cartilages are removed dorsal to the curvature of the costal cartilages. If specified by the purchaser, the diaphragm shall be removed. This anatomical description of the cut must be provided with the information for label approval. POTATO SAUSAGE, SWEDISH STYLE, OR POTATO RING OR POTATO PUDDING: Labels for sausages and pudding identified as ""Potato Sausage,"" ""Potato Brand Sausage,"" ""Potato Ring,"" and ""Potato Brand Sausage"" may be approved under the following guidelines: 1. The product must contain a minimum of 45 percent meat and no byproducts. 2. Water must be limited to 3 percent at formulation. 3. When extenders or binders are used, they must be limited to 3.5 percent or 2 percent in accordance with 9 CFR 424.21 of the finished product. 4.

See: Policy Memo 011 dated September 8, 1980 POULTRY: Cuts of poultry that are not identified in 9 CFR 381.168, Table V, may use the maximum amount of poultry skin permitted for that “kind.” For example, “turkey” is listed in the table and may contain up to 15 percent skin. Therefore, a product identified as “white turkey” can be placed in this category for a maximum of 15 percent skin. POULTRY, ASSORTED PIECES: The product name “Poultry (Kind) Assorted Pieces” is acceptable and does not require the product to be in natural proportions. In addition, the term “piece” is not the same as the term “part,” i.e., a piece does not have to be a whole part, e.g., a breast, thigh, or drumstick. POULTRY BACON: See: Bacon-Like Products POULTRY BREASTS: When poultry breasts with ribs are boned and the resulting product contains portions of the scapula (shoulder) muscles and/or muscle overlying the vertebral ribs, they must be labeled to indicate that fact. Proper names for such products are “Boneless Breast with Rib Meat,” White Chicken Meat or White Turkey Meat,” or if the skin is left intact, “White Boneless Chicken or White Boneless Turkey.” Product labeled “Boneless Breast” without further qualification may not contain scapula or rib meat. POULTRY FRANKFURTERS (SIMILAR COOKED SAUSAGES): Products which contain pork fat must be labeled with pork fat added in the product name. POULTRY GRADING: (LABELING) Indicates the quality grades of poultry (U.S. grade A, B, or C). The shield design contains the letters “USDA,” the U.S. grade of the product, and if not shown elsewhere, the class of poultry. Any letter grade on a consumer package or individual carcass indicates the product was graded by a licensed grader of the Federal or Federal-State grading service, and may not be applied otherwise. Letter grades on bulk packaging or shipping containers only indicate that the product is equal to that particular U.S. Grade.', 'A. APPLYING GRADEMARKS TO SHIPPING CONTAINERS All poultry classes and kinds listed in 9 CFR 381.170, except necks, giblets, detached tails, wing tips, skin and stripped backs (below Grade C) are eligible for grading. In addition, the following poultry parts may be officially graded: Boneless, Skinless Breast and Thigh Tenderloin or Boneless Breast without Tenderloin Boneless Breast Quarters Breast Quarters with Bone in Boneless Thigh Halves Wing Portion or Section Breast Halves Broiler Turkey or Duck Halves Split Breast Split Fryers Skinless, bone-in Thighs, Drums and Breasts Boneless Breast, Thigh Bone-in products marinated in a colorless solution Poultry cuts other than those identified above may not be eligible for grading; therefore, particular attention should be given to the product name when approving labels for various poultry products which include grade marks (for example, “Thin Breast Fillets, Thigh Strips”). Grade marks on raw poultry parts processed with solutions that may impart color (for example, injected with a 5% solution of water, salt, butter) or cooked poultry products are required to include a statement, for example, “Prepared from Grade A Poultry.” The USDA grader in the plant makes the final determination concerning the necessity of the “Prepared from” statement in situations where it is not apparent at the time of label approval that the added solutions have the ability to impart color to the finished poultry product. Products which may not be grade marked: Detached Necks Giblets Packed Separately Detached Tails Wings Tips Stripped Backs Below C Quality Diced or Shredded Meat B. WING DESCRIPTION The wing is made up of three sections. The section attached to the carcass is the first section. The wing tip is the third section. C.

Grade B Backs “with necks,” or “and necks.” c. Grade C Backs “with necks,” “Graded backs and necks,” or “backs and necks.” 2. Necks are to be packed with backs in natural proportions. 3. Necks may or may not be attached to backs. Necks for all officially graded backs are to be free from serious discolorations, feathers, pin feathers, and accumulations of blood and/or excess water. 4. A neck, front, or hind portion of back, when removed from birds which meet the stated quality, may be used to achieve exact weights. Only one of these portions may be used per package. Scraps of backs or necks may not be used. 5. Labels for packages with portions are required to indicate which portions, for example, first (1st) portion, 2nd portion, 1st and 2nd portions, 2nd and 3rd portions, etc. D. PRESSURE SENSITIVE STICKERS AND TAPE: 1. Inserts or pressure sensitive stickers with the grademark are required to have plant number. 2. Grademarks on pressure sensitive tape should not be used on consumer packages. 3. Insert with the grademarks are not to be used inside opaque bags. POULTRY HINDQUARTERS: The term “hindquarters” on labels for single cut poultry items is an acceptable alternative to the recognized terminology “Leg Quarter” specified in the regulations. The use of the term “Hindquarters” requires only a specified class of poultry to be considered a true product name, e.g., “Chicken Hindquarters.” Either term refers to a poultry thigh and drumstick, with a portion of the back attached.', ""POULTRY HINDSADDLES: Poultry hindsaddles are connected poultry leg quarters (the rear of the bird). The product name “Poultry Hindsaddles” may be used alone on the product's label if the product is not intended for retail sale. In contrast, the name “poultry hindsaddles” on the label of a product intended for retail sale must be accompanied by a fully descriptive name (e.g., “Poultry Hindsaddles, Connected Leg Quarters”). POULTRY MEAT, RAW: The labeling of raw poultry meat obtained from other than young poultry includes the class designation, e.g., “Yearling Turkey Meat” or “Mature Chicken Meat.” See: Policy Memo 032 dated September 4, 1981 See: 9 CFR 381.117(b) POULTRY PARTS: Specific net weight packages for poultry parts, usually those containing legs or wings, include a single part, e.g., a drumstick or thigh, to make the stated weight. The name on the label must reflect this practice, e.g. “Chicken Legs -Chicken Thigh added to make weight.” The single part must be cut at the joint. Wing tips are not permitted as added parts. POULTRY PRODUCTS: In poultry products where “meat” appears in the product name, e.g., “White Meat Chicken Roll,” and “Dark Meat Turkey Loaf,” skin and attached fat are permitted in greater than natural proportions. However, the ingredients statement must have the poultry skin or poultry fat listed. When skin and attached fat appear in the ingredients statement, their placement should be in the correct order of predominance and determined by the amount present over the permitted natural proportions. POULTRY PRODUCTS CONTAINING MEAT INGREDIENTS-LABELING: Poultry products containing meat in amounts that exceed 20 percent of the total meat and poultry product portion of the poultry product must be descriptively labeled to indicate the presence of the meat ingredients, e.g., “Chicken and Beef Stew or Stew made with Chicken and Beef”. Poultry products containing meat ingredients in amounts at 20 percent or less of the total meat and poultry product portion of the poultry product must have names that are qualified to indicate the presence of the livestock ingredients, e.g., “Chicken Stew-Beef Added”. However, poultry products that do not meet specified minimum poultry ingredient requirements because meat ingredients are replacing any part of the required poultry"", ""ingredients must be descriptively labeled to indicate the presence of meat ingredients, e.g., “Turkey and Pork Chop Suey”. See: Policy Memo 029 dated September 4, 1981 POULTRY PRODUCTS WITH OTHER THAN NATURAL PROPORTIONS OF WHITE AND DARK POULTRY: Poultry products containing white and dark chicken or turkey of a distinguishable nature and in quantities other than natural proportions of white to dark meat must bear a qualifying statement identifying the types of poultry meat used in conjunction with the kind of poultry in the product name. The poultry block of white and /dark meat (excluding products labeled as “Mechanically Separated (Kind of Poultry)”) solely determines the usage of the terms “white and dark,” “dark and light,” “white,” “dark,” etc. in the product name. Ground poultry (excluding the skin) that bears the terms “white/light,” “dark,” “breast,” “thigh,” etc. in the product names is also considered as part of the poultry block for determining the usage of terms “white and dark,” “dark and light,” “white,” “dark,” etc. However, products labeled as “Mechanically Separated (Kind)” do not have any bearing on the use of terms “white,” “light” or “dark” in the product name since, “Mechanically Separated (Kind)” is as indistinguishable paste-like product that is considered a separated standardized poultry food product ingredient. Additionally, products with mixture of distinguishable poultry (white or dark) and “Mechanically Separated (Kind)” can not bear claims of “all white,” “pure breast,” “100 percent dark,” or similar terms. In this situation, the poultry portion of the product contains at least two separated poultry ingredients, or one of which is “Mechanically Separated (Kind).” See 9 CFR 381.117(c), Table 1 POULTRY PUFFS: Product must contain at least 15 percent cooked poultry meat. Chicken or Turkey Puffs are classified as hors d'oeuvres and must show a true product name, e.g., “Breaded Chicken and Rice Balls.” POULTRY, RAW WITH ADDED SOLUTION: Unless addressed by other regulations and policies, water and/or oil based solutions may be added to raw poultry and poultry parts at various levels. The product name must contain a descriptive designative in accordance with 9 CFR 381.117(h). POULTRY SALAMI PRODUCTS: Poultry sausages prepared to resemble salami and offered to consumers as a salami shall bear product names as follows: 1. “(Kind) Salami” shall be the product name when the moisture-to-protein ratio in the finished product does not exceed 1.9:1. This product resembles a dry salami made from red meats."", '2. “Cooked (Kind) Salami” shall be the product name when the product is cooked and the moisture-to-protein ratio is above 1.9:1. This product resembles “cooked salami” made from red meats. See: Policy Memo 006 dated July 30, 1980 POULTRY SAUSAGE: Sausage products made from poultry must be labeled to indicate kind, e.g., “(Chicken) Sausage,” “(Turkey) Bologna,” etc. Products containing more than one kind of poultry or red meat must declare the added ingredient in the product name, e.g., “Chicken Bologna, Beef Added” and “Turkey Franks, Chicken Hearts Added” per Policy Memo 029 dated September 4, 1981. The basic sausage standards, per meat 9 CFR 319.140, also apply to poultry, except for added water and fat.', 'POULTRY SKIN: When determining the amount of poultry skin allowed, refer to 9 CFR 381.168. If the specific part is not identified in this part, use the figure for boneless kind.

See: Policy Memo 100 dated September 3, 1986 POULTRY WING SECTIONS -(KIND): Wing Sections is an acceptable designation for a product consisting of equal proportions of the parts of a wing. It may be and is usually used for equal proportions of wing portions and drummettes. PREMIER JUS OR (OLEO STOCK): The product obtained by rendering at low heat the fresh fat of heart, caul, kidney, and mesentery collected at the time of slaughter of bovine animals. The raw material does not include cutting fats. Premier Jus is not an acceptable name unless accompanied by the term “Oleo Stock.” PRESSURE SENSITIVE LABELS: Labels applied to packages shall be of the self-destructive type and must adhere to the packages under all conditions of use. PRESSURE SENSITIVE STICKERS AND INDELIBLE INK: Pressure sensitive stickers are as a means for manufacturers to use existing labeling material by covering inaccurate and/or misleading labeling information with corrected text or used as a promotional tool, e.g., a starburst encircling sweepstakes terminology. A pressure sensitive sticker must be the type that destroys the underlying label or package if removed, or be self-destructive. Similarly, indelible ink is used as a means for manufacturers to use existing labeling material by covering inaccurate and/or misleading labeling information with opaque ink or adding required information with a rubber stamp. Temporary label approval is not required when the entire label including the pressure sensitive sticker or marking/covering from indelible ink is truthful, not misleading, and the product is not misbranded. Corrected text on pressure sensitive sticker can cover mandatory or non-mandatory information. Indelible ink may be used to cover inaccurate information or apply markings to existing labeling material in order to make the labeling accurate and truthful. Labeling bearing pressure sensitive stickers or marking/covering from indelible ink falls under the provisions of the generic label approval regulations in 9 CFR 317.5 and 9 CFR 381.133, which provides the conditions for use of final labeling without first submitting sketch labeling for evaluation and approval at headquarters. Companies need to create and maintain records of all final labeling, otherwise known as generic approvals.', 'Consistent with the rules on generic labeling approval, sketch labeling approval is required for the entire label when pressure sensitive stickers or marking from indelible ink contain special claims (e.g., quality, nutrient content, health, negative, geographical origin, animal production (e.g., “no antibiotics administered,” breed claims, and “no hormones added”), and other claims (e.g., “natural”), guarantees, foreign language or a change of the nutrition facts serving size. For non-standardized amenable product labeling (e.g., descriptive name products, meat flavors or poultry reaction flavors, etc.) that received sketch approval and the existing labeling is modified by use of pressure sensitive stickers or indelible ink, a sketch approval is required when a change is made to the product label not covered by generic approval regulations 9 CFR 317.5(b) (9) and 381.133(b) (9), e.g., a product name change. Certain products are not compliant with the generic approval regulations, e.g., exotic animal product labeling, rabbit product labeling, certified pet food labeling, etc. In situations where existing labeling is modified by use of pressure sensitive stickers or indelible ink, the labels must be submitted to the Labeling Consumer Protection Staff in Washington, D.C for sketch approval. Transferred labels bearing a pressure sensitive sticker covering the existing legend or indelible ink covering the existing legend, are operating under the original establishment’s final label approval record, even though the establishment number is for that of the producing establishment. When pressure sensitive stickers are used to cover and correct other existing information or indelible ink is used to cover or add information, the rules for sketch approval and generic labeling apply to the entire label. This entry cancels Policy Memo 115 dated July 11, 1988, since 115 is out of date. PRIMAL PARTS AND SUBPRIMAL MEAT CUTS: Red meat carcasses, primals, subprimals or cuts can be labeled: 1) as the species of origin, e.g., beef tenderloin bearing the simple product name of “beef,” 2) as species without identifying the primal or subprimal when certain terms associated with various sizes are part of the product name, i.e., chop, cutlet, steak, fillet, filet, roast, strips, etc., e.g., “Beef Steak,” 3) as species and primal or subprimal cut, e.g., ""Veal Shoulder Blade Steak,"" and 4) as species, coin name (butt, cala, daisy, picnic, etc.) and primal or subprimal cut. The species and coin name are not appropriate as a complete product name since it is missing the primal or subprimal cut, e.g., the phrase “pork picnic” is incomplete without “shoulder.” Recent editions of the “Uniform Retail Meat Identity Standards (URMIS),” published and distributed by the National Livestock and Meat Board, and “The Meat Buyers Guide,” published by the National Association of Meat Purveyors, may be used to identify recommended names. These guides have been prepared through extensive review and analysis of the most recent edition of “Institutional Meat Purchase Specifications (IMPS)”', 'and in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agriculture Marketing Service (AMS) and public and industry associations. PRIME RIB OF BEEF OR STANDING BEEF RIB ROAST FOR PRIME RIB: These products do not have to be derived from USDA prime grade beef. PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL, ALTERNATE: The determination as to whether or not a panel is an alternate principal display panel shall be based on whether or not the panel is likely to be displayed, presented, shown, or examined under customary conditions of sale. If the intent of the panel cannot be determined and demonstrated, and if it has the appearance of a principal display panel, the presence of three or more mandatory labeling features shall serve to characterize the panel as an alternate principal panel. As such, any remaining mandatory features required to be placed on a principal display panel must be also included. See: Policy Memo 037 dated November 4, 1981 PRODUCT NAMES: 1. A product standard should only be applied if the product name is the same as that described by the standard in the regulations or in the Policy Book. For example, the product, “Beef, Cheese and Vegetables in a Crust,” would not be required to meet the standard for a “turnover” in the policy book. 2. Products such as “Pizza Pouches” must meet the standard for pizza since they are named “Pizza” even though they are not traditional type pizza. Furthermore, cheese may not be substituted for meat in products named “Pizza.” PRODUCT NAME QUALIFIERS: Product name qualifiers have no sizing requirements other than appearing contiguous to the product name and being prominent and conspicuous. Examples of product name qualifiers are “Smoked Flavor Added” and “Colored with Paprika.” PRODUCT NAME QUALIFERS IN SECONDARY PRODUCTS: Product name qualifiers, e.g., “binders added,” are not required on secondary products with labeling, with the exception of the statement “Calcium Propionate Added to Retard Spoilage of Crust” on pizza labeling. Secondary products are those meal like products that contain a multi-ingredient meat or poultry component, e.g., “Lemon Pepper Seasoned Chicken Breast with Rib Meat, Binders Added in ‘Lemon Pepper Chicken Breast with Vegetable Medley.’” The characteristics of the meat or poultry added ingredients, are disclose in the ingredients statement. See: Policy Memos 112 and 117', 'PRODUCT OF USA: Labeling may bear the phrase “Product of U.S.A.” under one of the following conditions: 1. If the country to which the product is exported requires this phrase, and the product is processed in the U.S., or 2. The product is processed in the U.S. (i.e., is of domestic origin). This entry cancels Policy Memo 080 dated April 16, 1985 PROSCIUTTO: Italian for ham, dry cured. The product name “Prosciutto” is acceptable on labeling to identify a dry-cured ham. PROSCIUTTO, COOKED: The product name “Cooked Prosciutto” is acceptable on labeling to identify a dry-cured Prosciutto ham that is cooked. PROSCIUTTO COTTO, COOKED HAM: The product name “Prosciutto Cotto, Cooked Ham” is acceptable on labeling to identify a regular pickle-cured cooked ham. Prosciutto Cotto is the Italian name for cooked ham. PROTECTIVE COVERINGS (MEAT): Processed or Prepared Product -Immediate containers, e.g., bags, cardboard cartons, tray packs, and film bags enclosing processed or prepared product can be considered protective coverings and exempt from the marking and labeling requirements if placed in a shipping container which meets all mandatory labeling requirements of an immediate container. This does not exempt the mandatory identification and marking which is specifically required on the immediate container of cooked beef (9 CFR 318.17). In addition, the shipping container must be clearly marked “Packed for Institutional Use” or an equally descriptive statement of intended limited distribution. Unlabeled product may not be removed from shipping containers for further distribution nor displayed or offered for sale.', 'Unprocessed Meat Cuts -Transparent film bags enclosing individual meat cuts in an unprocessed state can be considered protective coverings and exempt from the marking and labeling requirements if placed in a shipping container which meets all mandatory labeling of an immediate container. These unlabeled meat cuts may only be removed from the shipping container for resale and further distribution to retailers, hotels, restaurants, and similar institutions if the product itself or the film bag bears a clearly legible official mark of inspection and the establishment number. See: Policy Memo 090B dated December 18, 1990 PROTECTIVE COVERINGS (POULTRY): Under provision of the Poultry Products Inspection Act, protective coverings may be exempt from labeling requirements for immediate containers. Under certain circumstances, some protective coverings are considered immediate containers; under different circumstances, they are regarded only as protective product coverings. When plastic film bags, cardboard cartons, etc., are used for protecting poultry sold for export or to institutions, e.g., hotels, restaurants, and hospitals (where the contents are consumed on the premises), they are exempt from the mandatory labeling of immediate containers, provided the shipping container meets all the labeling requirements for an immediate container. Such product may not be diverted to retail channels and displayed for sale or be sold to household consumers unless they bear all labeling features required for immediate containers. See: 9 CFR 381.65(p) PUDDING: Nonspecific product. PULLED PORK: Refers to pork removed from bones by hand or by mechanical means. The meat must retain its natural striated muscle fiber structure, i.e., it can be shredded, chunked, etc., but may not be ground, chopped, or comminuted. QUALITY GRADE TERMS AND SUBJECTIVE TERMS ON LABELS: Terms designated as grades of meat, i.e., prime, choice, select, good, etc., may only be used on red meat which has been officially graded. However, the Food Labeling Division (FLD) will take no action to rescind currently approved labels which contain the word “select.” Labels for new or reformulated products or new product lines will be approved in accordance with the policy for grading terms described above.', ""Letter grades A,B,C, which are designated grades for poultry, may only be used on poultry (whole birds and parts) that are officially graded and may not be used on red meat. Although poultry grade terms (U.S. grade A, etc.) are not allowed to be used on red meats, the terms prime, choice, and select may be used on poultry (whole birds or parts) that are equivalent to U.S. grade A. The use of a possessive, e.g., XYZ's Prime, does not relieve a company of this requirement. The use of quality grade terms on further processed meat and poultry products will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine if they wrongly imply that the meat or poultry used in these products has been graded. Terms which are subjective in nature, e.g., but not limited to, fancy, finest, super, supreme, ultimate, premium, greatest, best, old fashioned, homestyle, hotelstyle, deluxe, special, famous, and old time may be used unqualified on labels for meat and/or poultry products. The term “selected” as well as other terms, will be considered individually by the Labeling and Consumer Protection Staff, again to determine if these terms wrongly imply that the meat or poultry has been graded. See: Policy Memo 101A dated August 30, 1988 QUICHE PRODUCTS: The term “Quiche” does not have to be qualified to indicate it is a custard cheese pie. However, when characterizing ingredients, e.g., bacon, ham, chicken, onion, etc. are used either alone or in combination, the ingredients shall be either clearly identified as part of the product name or prominently displayed elsewhere on the principal display panel (PDP) of the label (e.g., Bacon Quiche, Ham and Onion Quiche, etc.). Similarly, the characterizing ingredients in Quiches bearing fanciful names shall be identified as part of the product name or highlighted elsewhere on the PDP (e.g., Quiche Bercy -made with ham and wine). Since “Quiche Lorraine” is widely recognized, the characterizing ingredients do not have to be identified as a part of the product name or elsewhere on the PDP. Meat and poultry quiches must contain at least 8 percent cooked meat or poultry and sufficient cheese so that the combined total at least comprises 18 percent of the finished product. Quiche Lorraine must contain cooked bacon and/or ham and the only cheeses are Swiss and/or Gruyere. If other characterizing ingredients (excluding cheese), e.g., onions, peppers, olives, etc., are used in addition to the meat or poultry ingredient in Quiche Lorraine or in any other quiche, the combination of these other characterizing ingredients and the meat or poultry ingredients must comprise at least 8 percent of the total product, and the cooked meat or poultry portion must be at least 5 percent of the total product.

RICE AND MEAT: The product must contain at least 12 percent meat. ROASTED: The term “roasted” may be used to describe products that have been subjected to cooking methods that result in a roasted appearance. ROLLS: Six uses exist for the term “Roll” in conjunction with names for meat food products: 1.Items consisting of a solid piece of meat, for example, “Boned Veal Rib,” formed and tied as a roll and usually offered with seasonings. 2.Chopped meat in combination with condiments, also formed and processed. It can be and often is offered in the fresh meat state.', ""Water (or any other liquid) is not an ordinary or usual ingredient in the above “Meat Roll” items. If water (liquid) is an ingredient in these products and they are raw, then the product name must contain a descriptive designation in accordance with 9 CFR 317.2(e)(2). If water (liquid) is an ingredient in these products and they are cooked, then the product name must include a containing statement in accordance with Policy Memo 084A. 3. “Sausage Rolls” have similar formulas and water limitations to cooked sausage.

Typical “closed-faced” sandwiches consisting of two slices of bread or the top and bottom sections of a sliced bun that enclose meat or poultry, are not amenable to the Federal meat and poultry inspection laws. Therefore, they are not required to be inspected nor bear the marks of inspection when distributed in interstate commerce. SANDWICH -OPEN: Must contain at least 50 percent cooked meat. Sandwiches are amenable only if they are open faced sandwiches. Product must show a true product name, e.g., “Sliced Roast Beef on Bread.” This regulatory policy in no way alters the Department's present policy with respect to caterers who include meat sandwiches in their dinners. SANDWICHES (MEAT OR POULTRY AS COMPONENTS OF “DINNER PRODUCTS”): Dinners containing a sandwich type product, e.g., a frankfurter, hamburger, or sliced poultry meat with a bun, are amenable and subject to inspection."", 'SANTA FE STYLE: Acceptable for products that contain chilies with corn or beans and one of the following ingredients: Cheese (jack, cheddar, Mexican Style or fresh goat), bell pepper, onion, garlic, tomatoes, tomatillos, cumin, oregano or cilantro.

SAUERKRAUT BALLS WITH MEAT: Product must contain at least 30 percent meat or meat food product. SAUERKRAUT WITH FRANKS AND JUICE: Product must contain at least 20 percent franks. SAUSAGE CLASSIFICATION: Fresh Sausage: Made of fresh, uncured meat, generally cuts of fresh pork, and sometimes beef. Its taste, texture, tenderness, and color are related to the ratio of fat to lean. Trimmings from primal cuts, e.g., pork, loin, ham, and shoulders are often used. When ice or water is used to facilitate chopping and mixing, it is limited to a maximum of 3 percent of the total formula. It must be kept under refrigeration and thoroughly', 'cooked before serving. Bratwurst is in this class. Binders and extenders are permitted in fresh sausages except where regulations do not permit the use of such ingredients, i.e., 9 CFR 9 CFR 319.140 (Pork Sausage), 9 CFR 319.142 (Beef Sausage), 9 CFR 319.144 (Whole Hog Sausage), and 9 CFR 319.145 (Italian Sausage). See: 9 CFR 319 Subpart E Uncooked smoked sausage: Has all the characteristics of fresh sausage except it is smoked, producing a different flavor and color. It must be thoroughly cooked before serving. “Smoked Pork Sausage” is included in this class. If it is a mixture of pork and other meats, regardless of size, it must be treated for trichinae. See: 9 CFR 319 Subpart F Cooked sausages and/or Smoked sausages: These products are chopped or ground, seasoned, cooked and/or smoked. Added water is limited to 10 percent of the finished product. Meat byproducts may be used when permitted by standard. Cure is required for particular sausages, e.g., wieners or Polish sausage. These sausages come in various shapes and sizes, e.g., short, thin, long and chub. Cotto salami, liver sausage, and cooked weisswurst are included in this category. Wieners, bologna, knockwurst, etc., are also in this class but are further distinguished by a fat and moisture limitation. See: 9 CFR 319.180 Dry and Semi-dry sausages: Dry sausages may or may not be characterized by a bacterial fermentation. When fermented, the intentional encouragement of a lactic acid bacteria growth is useful as a meat preservative as well as producing the typical tangy flavor. The meat ingredients, after being mixed with spices and curing materials, are generally held for several days in a curing cooler. Afterward, the meat is stuffed into casings and is started on a carefully controlled air-drying process. Some dry sausage is given a light preliminary smoke, but the key production step is a relatively long, continuous air-drying process. Principal dry sausage products are salamis and cervelats. Salamis are coarsely cut, cervelats finely cut with few exceptions. They may be smoked, unsmoked, or cooked. Italian and French dry sausage are rarely smoked; other varieties usually are smoked. Dry sausage requires more production time than other types of sausage and results in a concentrated form of meat. Medium-dry sausage is about 70 percent of its “green” weight when sold. Less dry and fully dried sausage range from 80 percent to 60 percent of original weight at completion. Semi-dry sausages are usually heated in the smokehouse to fully cook the product and partially dry it. Semi-dry sausages are semi-soft sausages with good keeping qualities due to their lactic acid fermentation. Although dry and semi-dry sausages originally were produced in the winter for use in the summer and were considered summer sausage, the term “summer sausage” now refers to', 'semi-dry sausages, especially Thuringer Cervelat. SAUSAGE CONTAINING CHEESE: Sausages may contain cheese under the following conditions: 1. If there is a standard for that particular sausage, it must be met as though it contained no cheese. 7. The cheese must characterize the product and appear as part of the product name. Example “Italian Sausage with Cheese.” See: Policy Memo 010 dated September 8, 1980 SAUSAGE -LIQUIDS ADDED: Sausages containing fluid ingredients that are expected such as fruit and juice and vinegar, are permitted at any level as long as the product is descriptively labeled. The sausage portion of the product, however, must meet any applicable standard. Vinegar is an expected ingredient in chorizos and the name does not have to indicate its presence. SAUSAGE -SHELF STABLE: Dry sausage must have a Moisture Protein Ratio (MPR) of 1.9:1 or less, unless an MPR is cited under MOISTURE PROTEIN RATIO. Non-refrigerated, semi-dry, shelf-stable sausage must have an MPR of 3.1:1 or less and a pH of 5.0 or less, unless commercially sterilized or unless an MPR is cited under MOISTURE PROTEIN RATIO. Alternately, non-refrigerated, semi-dry, shelf-stable sausages are those that: 1. are fermented to a pH of 4.5 or lower (or pH may be as high as 4.6 if combined with product water activity no higher than 0.91), 2. are in an intact form or, if sliced, are vacuum packed, 3. have internal brine concentration no less than 5 percent, 4. are cured with nitrite or nitrate, and 5. are smoked with wood. SAUSAGE, REWORK: This term applies to a fully or partially processed product (excluding uncooked trimmings) re-routed for reasons other than unwholesomeness or adulteration (i.e., emulsion residue, product breakage, slicing operations, smoked meats, returns, etc.) and intended for inclusion in cooked sausage, loaves, and similar products. Rework may be used provided it does not adulterate the product, violate its standard of composition, change the order of predominance of ingredients, or perceptibly affect the normal', 'characteristics of the product. Rework is subject to the following restrictions: 1. Cooked sausage, meat loaves may be used in similar products without limitation. 2. Except in products covered by section 9 CFR 319.180, pieces of cooked and/or smoked meat may be used without limitation if properly identified in the ingredients statement. 3. Pieces of uncooked, cured pork from primal parts may be used without limitation if properly identified in the ingredients statement. 4. Sausage products in edible collagen casings may be used in similar finely comminuted products without limitation and need not be peeled. 5. Finished cooked sausage in natural casings may be used in similar finely comminuted products without limitation, except sausages in bungs, middles, beef rounds, bladders, or stomachs, which must be stripped of the casings before use. Also, natural casings of any type that break during the stuffing operations should not be included in emulsions. SAUSAGE TYPE PRODUCTS WITH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES: Sausage type products that contain unexpected ingredients that significantly alter the character of the product may be descriptively labeled as (characterizing ingredient) Sausage, e.g., “Cherry Pecan Sausage,” “Wild Rice Sausage,” or other equally descriptive names, e.g., “Sausage with Wild Rice.” The sausage portion of fresh sausage products must meet any applicable standards, including fat and added water limitations, moisture/protein ratios, and use of binders and extenders prior to the addition of any characterizing ingredient(s). For cooked, smoked, or dry sausages, the finished sausage type product must meet the sausage standard prior to the addition of any characterizing ingredients. The unexpected ingredient must be present in sufficient quantity or form to characterize the sausage type product in flavor, texture, or other sensory attributes. However, there are no minimum use levels. This policy applies to products containing unexpected food ingredients, e.g., fruits and vegetables, e.g., cherries, pecans, tomatoes, etc., that change the character of the product by the addition of unique flavor and other sensory characteristics. The policy does not apply to imitation products, i.e., products formulated to resemble in taste, texture, color, etc., the traditional sausage products, but which are nutritionally inferior. Sausages containing cheese are addressed Policy Memo 010, and Potato Sausages are addressed in Policy Memo 011.

Although not required or customary, smoke can also appear in the ingredients statement of domestically produced products which are physically smoked. If included in the ingredients statement, smoke should appear as the last item. SMOKE FLAVORING: The use of smoke flavoring (natural or artificial) in a component of a meat or poultry food product, e.g., ham in a ham salad, does not require that the product name be qualified to indicate the presence of the smoke flavoring. However, the smoke flavoring must be declared in the ingredients statement on the meat or poultry product labels. Secondary product – when meat and extender product is produced using a meat product in which smoke flavoring is added, the secondary product name does not have to be qualified with a phrase as “smoke flavoring added.” When smoke flavor (natural or artificial) has been directly added to a product as part of a seasoning mix, the presence of the smoke flavor must be identified in a qualifying statement to the product name, e.g. 1. “Chicken soup smoked flavor added,” and in the ingredients statement. 2. “Beef soup smoke flavor.” 3.

Meat or poultry products may be labeled “Smoked” if natural liquid smoke flavor is applied by spraying, dipping, liquid flooding, or similar processes prior to or during heat processing. In such cases, the natural liquid smoke flavoring must be transformed into a true gaseous state by the heat of processing. If a product is simply sprayed with liquid smoke it must be labeled “smoke flavoring added.” 4. Meat or poultry products to which smoke flavor (natural or artificial) has been directly applied to the exposed product surface, e.g., massaging or margination, or incorporated into the product by such means as injection, must be labeled to identify the smoke flavor as part of the product name, e.g., “Ham-Natural Smoke Flavor Added,” and in the ingredients statement. 5. Meat or poultry products that are smoked, as provided for in (1), (2) and (3) above and also treated with smoke flavor as described in (4), may only be labeled “Smoked” or with terms, e.g., “Naturally Smoked,” if it is clearly disclosed that the product is also treated with smoke flavor.

TURKEY CHOPS: Turkey chops are prepared by cutting the frozen breast into slabs with each cut being made perpendicular to the long axis of the keel bone (sternum). The larger slabs are split in half through the center of the sternum, resulting in two individual servings of meat with a piece of bone on one side and a thin layer of skin on the other. The smaller pieces at each end of the breast are left intact as individual servings. The word steak is unsuitable because a turkey steak is boneless by definition. TURKEY HAM PRODUCTS CONTAINING ADDED WATER: Product otherwise conforming to the standard for turkey ham under section 9 CFR 381.171 of the poultry products inspection regulations but weighing more than the original weight of the turkey thigh meat used prior to curing shall be descriptively labeled as follows: 1.

A manufacturer holds trademark rights to the terms “Vienna” and “Vienna Beef.” VINEGAR: Product must contain at least 4 grams of acetic acid per 100 cubic centimeters (approximately 4 percent acetic acid). This strength is referred to as 40 grain vinegar. Cider vinegar, which during the course of manufacture has developed an excess of acetic acid over 4 percent, may be reduced to a strength not less 4 percent. Cider vinegar so reduced is not regarded as adulterated but must be labeled as to its nature as “diluted” or “water added” cider vinegar. However, when vinegar of any concentration (not less than 4 percent acetic acid) is used in a food product, the only labeling requirement is “vinegar.” Statements like “diluted” or “water added” are not required. VINEGAR PICKLE: Sausage in vinegar pickle is approved with the understanding that sausage is completely covered with pickle and that the pickle has a pH level not higher than 4.5. WATER BASE SOLUTIONS IN RED MEAT IN MEAT PRODUCTS: Many raw red meat products with added solutions are required to be labeled in accordance with 9 CFR 317.2(e)(2) to indicate the addition of a solution has taken place, for example, “Beef Containing 6% of a Solution of water, teriyaki sauce, and spices.” As explained below, these requirements do not apply to except for cured red meat products that meet a standard of identity in 9 CFR 319.100-105. See the Final Rule Descriptive Designation for Raw Meat and Poultry Products Containing Added Solutions (79 FR 79044; Dec. 31, 2014). In situations where a raw product’s surface is coated by rubbing, spraying, or dipping water mixed with seasonings, flavorings, etc., onto the surface of the meat, the qualifying statement describing this treatment does not have to include the percentage of solution. If,', 'however, these components are incorporated into the raw product by excessive rubbing, massaging, or tumbling, a descriptive designation indicating the composition and the amount of any solution absorbed is needed in accordance with 9 CFR 317.2(e)(2). Since the regulations (9 CFR 319.101 and 102) allow uncooked corned beef brisket to contain 20 percent of a curing solution, and uncooked corned beef round and other cuts to contain 10 percent of a curing solution above the weight of the fresh, uncured (green weight) product without disclosure, 9 CFR 317.2(e)(2) would not apply unless the product does not meet the standard of identity in accordance with 9 CFR 317.2(e)(2). 9 CFR 317.2(e)(2) does not apply to uncooked cured pork products that are labeled and manufactured in accordance with the standards of identity for cured pork products in (9 CFR 319.104 and 105) If the product does not meet these standards then it is required to be labeled in accordance with 9 CFR 317.2(e)(2). However, 9 CFR 317.2(e)(2) would apply to uncooked cured pork trimmings or uncooked cured pork products that contain added solutions that are not labeled and manufactured in accordance with or are not subject to a standard of identity for cured pork products, such as hams, loins, shoulders, butts, picnic, hocks, jowls, etc. The addition of an enzyme solution to meat products is limited to 3 percent of the raw meat product (green weight) by the meat inspection regulations (9 CFR 424.21). If a product is treated with an enzyme solution and a flavoring solution, separately or in one step, both treatments are required to be identified on the label. The label must contain a descriptive designation indicating the percent flavoring solution, and a product name qualifier, such as “Tenderized with Papain” in accordance with 9 CFR 317.8(b)(25). In this case, product qualifying statements should not intervene between the product name and the descriptive designation for the solution. Alternately, the descriptive designation and the product qualifying statement may be combined into one statement. For example, an acceptable name for raw beef pumped with 10% solution that contains papain could be “beef contains up to 7% tenderizing and seasoning solution of water, teriyaki sauce, spices, and papain.” For uncooked products, the percent added solution for the label statement is determined by subtracting the fresh (green) weight of the article from the weight of the finished (total) product that is, after injecting, marinating, etc., dividing by the weight of the fresh article, and multiplying by 100. Cooked red meat products containing added solutions are addressed in Policy Memo 084A WATER-DECLARATION: The use of water must be declared in the ingredients statement of all products with the exception of the following: 1. The water added to lactic acid starter culture (.05 percent or less) for the purpose of rehydration. 2. The water added to products which are freeze-dried or sprayed-dried. WATER IN CANNED SAUSAGE:', 'Water, not to exceed 8 percent of the total product weight, may be used in the preparation of precooked pork sausage links intended for canning. The amount of water used is for the purpose of replacing that which is lost during the processing operation that takes place prior to canning. The weight of the sausage at the time of canning shall not exceed the weight of the fresh uncured meat ingredients plus the weight of the curing ingredients and the seasoning ingredients. WATER-MISTED AND ICE-GLAZED MEAT AND POULTRY PRODUCTS: When meat or poultry products are water-misted or ice-glazed, the net weight of the product may not include the weight of the water or ice. An acknowledgment to this effect must be indicated on the label application form. A prominent and conspicuous statement must appear on the principal display panel adjacent to the product name, describing that the product is protected with a water-mist or ice glaze (e.g., “Product Protected with Ice Glaze”).', ""If the manufacturer can show that a water or ice glaze is sublimed from the unpackaged product during freezing so as not to compromise the integrity of the product's formulation or the standard with which it must comply, the labeling of the product need not bear the statements identified above. Because the regulatory standard 9 CFR 319.15 precludes the addition of water -hamburger, ground beef and chopped beef patties cannot be ice-glazed and, if there is evidence of an ice-glaze on such patties subsequent to freezing, they must be labeled appropriately to be sold in commerce, e.g., as “beef patties.” However, water-misting of formed hamburger, ground beef, or chopped beef patties just prior to freezing individual patties is permitted if (1) the water applied in misting acts as a processing aid to prevent shrinkage of the patties, and (2) the misted water sublimes from the surface of the patties during the freezing process such that the weight of the patty exiting the freezer does not exceed the green weight of the patty just prior to water-misting and freezing. See: Policy Memo 108B dated June 24, 1993 WEISSWURST: A name for uncured sausage usually made of pork or veal. It is of German origin and means white sausage. The color of the sausage after cooking is white because of the lack of cure and the type of meat used. Weisswurst is similar to Bratwurst. When milk or milk and eggs are added to a Weisswurst batch, it should be labeled as “Kalbsbratwurst” or “Bockwurst” respectively. WELSH RAREBIT SAUCE WITH COOKED HAM: Product must contain at least 20 percent cooked ham in the total formulation. WHEAT GLUTEN: Acceptable for use to bind fresh meat cuts, e.g., boneless loins, boneless legs, and livers together, so that they may be cooked and sliced without falling apart. The amount used should not exceed 2 percent of the weight of the total product. The product name shall be qualified by the phrase “Wheat Gluten Added.” Wheat gluten is not acceptable for use with chunked and/or chopped specific products as roasts, rolls, and reformed meat cuts. Acceptable in nonspecific products and home-style meat loaves within the prescribed limits of other extenders and binders."", 'WHOLE HOG SAUSAGE: Must contain all primal parts of a hog. Hearts and tongues, in natural proportions, are permitted ingredients in whole hog sausage when declared in the ingredients statement. Other meat byproducts are not permitted in whole hog sausage. See: 9 CFR 319.144 WIENER SCHNITZEL (GR): A veal cutlet prepared by dipping in egg, flour, and bread crumbs and frying to a golden brown. WILD BOAR: Products prepared from wild boar from feral swine are amenable and subject to the meat inspection regulations. “Wild Boar” is an acceptable label term for a product, provided the words “Wild Boar” are directly followed by the statement “Meat from Feral Swine.” The statement “Meat from Feral Swine” must appear prominently on the principle display panel as described in 9 CFR 317.2(d)(1)(2) and (3). If the statement “Meat from Feral Swine” does not directly follow the term “Wild Boar,” then an asterisk may be included with the term “Wild Boar” and the statement “Meat from Feral Swine” should appear prominently elsewhere on the principal display panel. “Wild Boar from Feral Swine,” “Wild Boar Meat from Feral Swine,” “Wild Boar (byproduct) from Feral Swine,” are also acceptable product names. In order to obtain approval for a product label bearing the name “Wild Boar from Feral Swine,” or similar acceptable names, a statement describing and verifying the following physical and environmental characteristics typical of wild boar is required: color patterns, e.g., white stripes or spots, longer bristly haircoat, elongated snout with visible tusks, a “razorback” body shape, and wild boar males which are uncastrated. (We acknowledge both males and females under the term “Wild Boar.”) The purchased hogs should be obtained from a nonrestrictive environment which permits foraging for uncultivated feed, natural selection, and breeding and farrowing without confinement. A letter should be submitted with “Wild Boar from Feral Swine” labels describing the environment where such swine live and their method of capture or entrapment. These same criteria would also apply to imported “Wild Boar Meat from Feral Swine” and arrangements should be made through Foreign Programs for slaughter and export from approved establishments. In multi-ingredient products, e.g., “Beans in Sauce with Wild Boar,” the “Wild Boar” part of the product name must be followed by an asterisk and a statement “(Meat or meat byproduct) from Feral Swine” must appear somewhere on the principal display panel. The ingredient wild boar, wild boar meat, or wild boar byproduct, must be listed as “Wild', 'Boar ((Meat or meat byproduct) From Feral Swine)” in the ingredients statement in its proper order of predominance. See: Policy Memo 097 dated June 4, 1986 WING SECTIONS: First wing section is described as the wing drummette Second wing section is described as the wing portion Wings Sections is an acceptable wing term for both wing drummette and wing portion when in natural proportions. WITH NATURAL JUICES (POULTRY): The term “With Natural Juices” may be used with poultry products to indicate the presence of cooked out juices derived solely from the liquid normally associated with the poultry prior to cooking. If liquids have been added to the poultry prior to cooking, natural can not be used. WRAPS: A ready-to-eat meat/poultry food product that may contain vegetables and seasoning ingredients and is wrapped in a dough based component, e.g., tortilla. The product name must bear the kind or species, e.g., “Ham Wraps.” The minimum meat or poultry requirement is 2 percent cooked meat or 2 percent cooked poultry meat. YEARLING: The term “yearling” (e.g. yearling beef) may be used to describe an animal of either sex that is too old to be classified as a calf or lamb but less than 2 years of age. The company is required to segregate carcasses and provide product identification to insure that no commingling occurs between qualifying and nonqualifying products. The terms “Yearling Ovine”, “Yearling Mutton” and “Yearling Sheep Meat” are acceptable product names for meat derived from sheep between 1 and 2 years of age.
