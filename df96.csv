FSIS requests that all eligible countries submit their 2019 Chemical Residue Control Program Plan and 2018 Residue Control Program Results. The tables included in this guidance are to assist Central Competent Authorities (CCAs) provide FSIS with the information requested in FSIS’s Self-Reporting Tool (SRT) question, Government Chemical Residues Testing Programs. FSIS is providing suggested reporting table formats for the annual data submissions of the 2019 Residue Control Program Plan and 2018 Residue Control Program Results that are due to FSIS by May 18, 2019. The use of these reporting table formats is optional; FSIS will review information submitted in other formats. The information that should be submitted includes: • 2019 FSIS Residue Control Plan (Table 1 – suggested reporting format) 1) Names of individual compounds for each slaughter class or, if providing a method, then a list of individual compounds for each method 2) Proposed tissue (e.g., muscle, liver, kidney) for sample collection 3) Analytical methodology used to evaluate each compound for regulatory decision making 4) Established tolerance or action level, (e.g., maximum residue limit (MRL) 5) Proposed number of samples for each production class for each chemical compound 6) Criteria used to determine the proposed sampling number (e.g., statistical basis, etc.) 7) Criteria used to determine whether a compound is included or removed from the testing program 8) Processes for reassessing the yearly chemical residue plan and for reviewing the data and identifying specific violations or violation trends 9) Indicate whether livestock (beef, pork, goat, sheep) carcasses are held pending negative laboratory test results before exported to the US • 2018 FSIS Residue Control Program Results (Table 2 – suggested reporting format) 1) Actual number of samples analyzed for each production class for each chemical compound and number of violative results 2) Description of the CCA’s enforcement strategy in response to violative results Countries testing applicable processed products should include this information in their submission. Regarding the 2019 FSIS Residue Control Annual Plan, FSIS is including the attachment, FSIS Government Residue Control Program, as a reference. This attachment includes sampling and testing frequencies for FSIS government testing programs. The 2019 FSIS Residue Control Annual Plan and the 2018 Residue Control Program Annual Results can be submitted to FSIS by either uploading it into our Public Health Information System (PHIS) under SRT question, Government Chemical Residues Testing Programs, or by submitting it to our International Coordination Executive at: US Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service Office of International Coordination Room 3143, South Building 1400 Independence Ave SW Washington D.C. 20250-3700 Fax: 1-202-690-3856 E-mail: InternationalCoordination@fsis.usda.gov', 'FSIS Guidance for Suggested Reporting Tables of the Government Chemical Residue Control Program NOTE: This document is updated from the 2018 version but does not contain substantive changes to the suggested reporting format. For your reference, please see the links below for FSIS’s Residue Sampling Plan and Results: • FSIS Residue Sampling Plans (Blue Book) • FSIS Residue Sample Results (Red Book) • FSIS Directive 10,800.11, Residue Sampling, Testing and Other Verification Procedures under the National Residue Program for Meat and Poultry Products Table 1: Suggested Reporting Table for the 2019 Government Residue Control Program Annual Plan. Please include the following information below for the product categories for which the CCA is currently equivalent or seeking equivalence. (The information provided in the table is for illustrative purposes only) Species (subspecies) Compound class2 Compound3 Sampling location (e.g., farm/ establishment) Tissue (e.g., kidney, liver, muscle) Analytical methodology for regulatory decision making Limit of confirmation (with units) Action Level or Maximum Residue Level (with units)4 Number of samples planned Bovine (veal, cattle) Aminoglycosides Neomycin Farm Kidney LC MS/MS 10 ppb 15 ppb 300 Table 2: Suggested Reporting Table for the 2018 Government Residue Control Program Annual Results. Please include the following information below for the product categories for which the CCA is currently equivalent or if the data exists, seeking equivalence. (The information provided in the table is for illustrative purposes only) Species (subspecies) Compound Analyzed Tissue (e.g., kidney, liver, muscle) Number of samples analyzed Number of samples above tolerance or MRL Violative levels Follow-Up Actions Bovine (veal, cattle) Neomycin Kidney 300 1 50 ppb Briefly describe the CCA’s enforcement strategy in response to violative results (e.g., investigation, trace back, corrective action (root cause), punitive/legal sanctions, etc.) Ex: All suspect carcasses declared unfit for human consumption and destroyed. Full on farm investigations including examination of medicines on farm and animal remedies record were carried out in each case. As appropriate, advice is given to the farmer and follow-up visits take place. 1 FSIS Directive 10,800.1 also available in Arabic, Chinese, Spanish, and Vietnamese translations. 2 Include the compound class for the chemical compound being analyzed. 3 Include the name of the individual chemical compound being analyzed. Please note that compound class alone is not sufficient. 4 Include the regulatory limit for the compound. This may be an “action level” or a “maximum residue level”.']"
