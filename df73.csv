The purpose of this compliance guideline is to help industry determine which statements are permitted on the labeling of their products and the criteria for their use. The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) ensures that the labeling of meat, poultry and egg products is truthful and not misleading. FSIS considers labeling bearing any reference to Omega fatty acids to be a special statement or claim. The regulations require establishments to submit all labels bearing special statements or claims to the Agency’s Labeling and Program Delivery Staff for evaluation and approval before use. However, once a label with a statement on Omega fatty acids is approved, there are many types of changes to the label that are generically approved and don’t require submission to the Agency for approval prior to use (for example, change in net weight, label color, vignettes, cooking instructions, and the addition of information that is not considered a special statement or claim). The key for making the change generically is that the change cannot affect the special statement or claim (see slide 40 on the following PowerPoint Presentation Generic Label Approval). Who is this guideline designed for? This guidance is for establishments that are designing or modifying meat, poultry or egg product labels with statements related to Omega fatty acids. What changes have been made to the guidance from the last version? FSIS previously issued guidance on omega fatty acids claims on July 11, 2007. FSIS has updated the guideline to include further details and explanations on the different types of claims and a key-points reference chart. How can I comment on this guideline?

FACTUAL STATEMENTS (fatty acid content from raising animals with naturally occurring foods added to feed) Yes (requires FSIS approval under 9CFR 412.1) - “X milligrams of CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid) per serving” - “X grams of Omega-3 Fatty Acids per serving” 1) Omega fatty acid content cannot come from fortification; 2) Include the nutrition facts panel on label; 3) Provide data to support Omega fatty acid content; plus 4) Provide feed formulation and animal raising documentation. LEVEL CHARACTERIZATION No - “Good Source of Omega-3 Fatty Acids” - “More than X grams of Omega-3 Fatty Acids” These statements are not permitted because there are no defined claims for Omega fatty acids. COMPANY/BRAND NAMES (Trademarked company/brand name associated with omega fatty acids) Yes (in signature line only; requires FSIS approval under 9CFR 412.1) - “Omega 3 Company” Signature line is placed on information panel and is not given undue prominence. TRADEMARKED SYMBOLS/LOGOS (Trademarked symbols/logos associated with omega fatty acids) No These symbols and similar logos are not permitted because there are no defined claims or synonyms for Omega fatty acids 5', 'Omega Fatty Acid Claims on the Labeling of Meat, Poultry and Egg Products TYPES OF OMEGA FATTY ACIDS This guidance document applies to making factual statements for Omega-3 fatty acids, Omega-6 fatty acids, and Omega-9 fatty acids. It is also applicable for statements that identify specific Omega fatty acids by name, for example, Alpha-Linolenic Acid (ALA), which is a specific omega-3 fatty acid or Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA), which is a specific Omega-6 fatty acid. FACTUAL STATEMENTS FSIS permits factual statements on the labeling of meat, poultry, and egg products that declare the amount of Omega fatty acids per serving, provided: 1) Establishments obtain sketch approval through FSIS, LPDS for Labeling that includes Omega fatty acid statements or any reference (direct or implied) to omega fatty acids; 2) The product is not fortified to provide the Omega fatty acid content, 3) The labeling bears a nutrition facts panel in compliance with 9 CFR 317.309, 381.409, or 590.411(e) to identify the serving size of the product, 4) Data documenting the Omega fatty acid content per labeled serving is provided with the label application submitted to LPDS for approval, and 5) The labeling includes a statement identifying the type and amount of Omega fatty acid(s) per serving and the common or usual name of the food source(s)1 from which the Omega fatty acids are obtained (for example, “X milligrams of Omega-3 Fatty Acids per serving from flax seed in breading”). NOTE: See label example 1 When the level of Omega fatty acids is integral in the animal tissue as a result of specialized diets fed to animals, for example, grass fed cattle or raising chickens on a feed formulated with flaxseeds or other whole food sources1 with naturally occurring (indigenous) Omega fatty acids, the same criteria above apply except that the food source1 of the Omega fatty acid does not need to be declared on the labeling. For example, grass fed beef might include the statement “Xmg of Omega-6 fatty acids per serving.” In this situation, documentation to support the specialized feeding formula and raising plan for the animal will also need to be included as part of the label application submitted for approval. When making statements about specific Omega fatty acids, use the full fatty acid name with the statement not just the abbreviation, for example, “Xmg Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) per serving”, (on grass fed beef) or prominently link the abbreviated name to the full name with an asterisk or other symbol on the same label panel as the statement. 1 Commonly used foods sources with naturally occurring (indigenous) Omega fatty acids include: fish oil, canola oil, flaxseeds, and walnuts. When adding omega fatty acid sources to animal feeds the food sources would also include plant material such as grass. 6', 'For example, “Xmg of CLA* per serving” displayed on same panel as “*Conjugated Linoleic Acid.” Grams and milligrams The amount of the Omega fatty acids per serving on the label may be expressed either as the number of milligrams per serving or the number of grams per serving. The number of grams may be declared to the nearest one thousandth gram, for example, “0.125 grams Omega-3 fatty acids per serving from flax seed.” NOTE: See label example 2 LEVEL CHARACTERIZATION STATEMENTS FSIS will not approve statements that declare or imply that the product is a good or excellent source of Omega fatty acids per serving. The nutrition labeling regulations in Title 9, Code of Federal Regulations (9 CFR), Subpart B, Section 317.313(b), for red meat products, Subpart Y, Sections 381.413(b), for poultry products, and Title 21 CFR Subpart A, Section 101.13(b) clearly state that “A claim which, expressly or by implication, characterizes the level of a nutrient (nutrient content claim) of the type required in nutrition labeling …, may not be made on a label or in labeling of that product unless the claim is made in accordance with the applicable provisions in this subpart.” Therefore, without regulations defining such claims, the use of statements with expressed Omega-3 fatty acid claims, including, but not limited to “Good Source of Omega-3 Fatty Acids” and “Excellent Source of Omega-3 Fatty Acids,” cannot be approved. Likewise, labeling for meat, poultry, and egg products that bear claims that imply that the level of Omega fatty acids in a product is high or place significance on a specific level of Omega Fatty Acids, including, but not limited to “Contains X grams of Omega-3 Fatty Acids,” “More than X grams of Omega-6 Fatty Acids” and “Fortified with X grams of Omega-9 Fatty Acids,” “With…”, “Provides…”, “Packed with…”, etc., cannot be approved. TRADEMARKS, AND COMPANY NAMES Trademarked company brand names, trademarked symbols or phrases, and statements included in ad-copy on labeling that declare or imply that the product is a good or excellent source of Omega fatty acids per serving, or declare or imply a particular level of Omega fatty acids per serving using a similar wording a level of Omega fatty acids in a product cannot be approved. One exception, is that the company name may be labeled as part of the signature line for compliance with 9 CFR 317.2(g), 381.122, and 590.411 (c) (2) provided the signature line is only displayed on the information panel in normal size font so that it is not given undue prominence which would cause the use of the company name to be a false or misleading.
