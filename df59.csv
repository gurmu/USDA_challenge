PURPOSE To provide guidance to State Cooperative Meat and Poultry Inspection (MPI) programs electing to use a data system other than FSIS’s Public Health Information System (PHIS) for meeting the “at least equal to” data system essentials. II. BACKGROUND The Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) (21 USC 661) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) (21 USC 454) provide for FSIS to cooperate with State agencies in developing and administering their own Meat and Poultry Inspection Programs. Individual State MPI programs are required to operate in a manner and with authorities that are “at least equal to” the antemortem and post-mortem inspection, reinspection, sanitation, recordkeeping, and enforcement provisions as provided for in the FMIA and PPIA. Therefore, State MPI programs are required to develop a data system with characteristics that can produce inspection and recordkeeping outcomes “at least equal to” FSIS’s procedures. FSIS maintains PHIS as its data system. PHIS functions as an integrated data collection and analysis system that verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of Agency inspection. FSIS relies heavily on data to promote proactive decisions affecting food safety and public health and has strengthened both its data collection and analysis activities to ensure valid, timely data is collected, carefully analyzed, and continually reported. FSIS ensures that data collected through PHIS is fully available and organized so that the analysis of data from FSIS’s regulatory verification and compliance and enforcement activities, sampling, and other sources of data provide the Agency with evidence that shows whether or not the Agency’s approach is working. To determine the success of the strategies used to combat threats to food safety and defense, FSIS employs data analysis as a management verification measure that helps ensure that the program components are effective in meeting the Agency’s public health goals and objectives. FSIS recognizes that an integrated infrastructure with high quality data and feedback interaction is essential to a data-driven approach to inspection. A data-driven approach to inspection requires quality data collection methods, ongoing data analysis to refine analytical decisionmaking tools, and performance measures to assess the impact of policies and programs. PHIS is designed to consolidate and integrate the Agency’s critical functions of inspection, surveillance, auditing, enforcement, scheduling, modeling, and analysis to provide better public health protection. It also reduces delays in FSIS decision-making by providing feedback loops that utilize the data input by the inspection staff and laboratory test results to drive automated scheduling functions, reporting functions, and alerting of events. PHIS uses the Task Library to develop the Task List for each establishment. Each task arrives on the inspection program personnel’s (IPP) Task List with a due date and a frequency for performing the task. The inspectors then have the ability to place assigned tasks onto their personal Task Calendars and to schedule them for completion. PHIS gives IPP the flexibility to schedule tasks. As tasks are completed, IPP record their findings of compliance and non-compliance in PHIS. FSIS uses PHIS data to schedule follow-up tasks and additional lab sampling as required. There are feedback loops in PHIS that produce information vital to all levels of FSIS. Information and revised schedules are fed back to field personnel. Headquarters and District management generate reports to keep apprised of critical information for decision-making. Alerts and notifications are issued to Headquarters and IPP as events occur. The automated 2', 'January 8, 2015 feedback mechanisms are designed to reduce delays where action is required, through a system of specific input points. Alerts are issued when specific events requiring immediate attention occur. An alert consists of a “trigger” and a “notification” function. The trigger is a program that automatically scans the data for a specific event, and upon finding it, issues the notification. The notification can take the form of an email sent by PHIS, a message on the user’s PHIS dashboard, or both. Examples of key events that would trigger an alert are: a large number of inspection activities not completed at an establishment, high rates of noncompliance in an establishment, and a positive adulterant pathogen test result at an establishment (e.g., Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7 in raw ground beef, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) in beef manufacturing trimmings, or Listeria monocytogenes (Lm)/Salmonella in ready-to-eat (RTE) products). The alert text gives directions to IPP by pointing them to the appropriate regulations and directives needed for the response. Reports are produced by PHIS that include aggregated data representing a period of time rather than a single specific event. Reports may be produced on demand and viewed online or offline. Reports allow users to access data and can be set up to flag irregular data so that users can investigate further and take corrective action. PHIS has a wide range of reporting capabilities and can produce a variety of reports. An example of a generated report is the monthly report of non-compliances by District. Reports are used at all levels of FSIS to manage the processes, to identify areas needing corrective actions, and to communicate progress towards goals. III. ELEMENTS OF AN “AT LEAST EQUAL TO” DATA SYSTEM To be “at least equal to” FSIS’s system, the State MPI data system needs to: • Collect, analyze, and respond to establishment and State MPI program data • Monitor data streams to determine establishment performance, and • Respond, near real-time, to establishments that may pose a risk to public health Also to be “at least equal to,” the State MPI data system needs to collect data from the following four activities: 1. Daily inspection verification activities at operating establishments 2. State MPI program HACCP verification testing 3. State MPI program in-depth food safety reviews 4. State MPI program administrative enforcement actions Set out below are guidance and recommendations for State MPI programs on their data systems if they choose not to participate in PHIS. State MPI programs should monitor data collected from the four activities listed above. The data collected should be compared to different data sets (e.g., data of multiple circuits, data of multiple establishments, and data from previous months) and analyzed to determine whether the State MPI program is meeting program goals and objectives. State MPI programs should take appropriate actions, based on the analysis, when goals and objectives are not being met. 1. Daily inspection verification activities at operating establishments Data Collection State MPI programs should collect establishment demographics (profiles). These profiles should include critical up-to-date information about the establishment’s size, products 3', 'January 8, 2015 produced, production volume, recall history, non-compliance history, and food defense plans. HACCP information for the establishment should be available in the profile and include summary information, processing categories, food safety hazards, critical control points, and prerequisite programs. A State MPI program should ensure IPP verify that establishments’ profile information is accurate and current at set intervals (e.g., at least every thirty days or whenever HACCP plans change). NOTE: The FSIS PHIS Inspection Task Catalog is provided as an attachment to this guidance. This Task Catalog is subject to change, but it sets out the PHIS tasks available based on establishment profile information. Data Analysis The State MPI program’s data system should contain public health-based decision criteria to identify establishments requiring more frequent inspection activities (e.g., increased directed food safety verification tasks). The State MPI program’s data system should include a mechanism to react to inspection results. Examples of events or trends that would trigger the State MPI program to react to inspection results may include, but are not limited to: • A large number of inspection activities not completed in an establishment • High rates of non-compliance in an establishment • A positive pathogen test result in an establishment (e.g., E. coli O157:H7 in raw ground beef or Lm in RTE products) • Infrequent establishment profile updates (e.g., HACCP plan changes failed to be identified or documented) • Tasks are not being performed at frequencies sufficient to ensure public health The State MPI programs should ensure data quality and accuracy (i.e., a system identifying outdated establishment profile information, unperformed tasks). 2. State MPI program HACCP verification testing Data Collection The State MPI programs should maintain a system for tracking pathogen and residue testing results. Data Analysis The State MPI program’s verification testing system should contain public health-based decision criteria to identify establishments requiring more frequent inspection activities (e.g., increased directed sampling due to positive sampling results or concerns with establishment’s production process). The system should include a mechanism to react to sampling results. Examples of events that would trigger the program to react to sampling results may include but are not limited to: • A large number of sampling activities not completed in an establishment • A large number of laboratory discards • Positive sampling results in an establishment for adulterant pathogens (e.g., E. coli O157:H7 in raw ground beef, STEC in beef manufacturing trimmings, or Lm/Salmonella in RTE products) 4', 'January 8, 2015 • Violative residues • Identifying long term processes that may have exceeded their schedule (e.g., a Salmonella sample set that has not been finished) 3. State MPI program in-depth food safety reviews State MPI programs should have procedures (e.g., Food Safety Assessments (FSA)) in place to verify that an establishment’s food safety systems are effective and producing wholesome unadulterated product. Data Collection A system should track routine and “for cause” in-depth food safety reviews. Data Analysis The State MPI program’s data system should include a mechanism to react to sampling and inspection results that could lead to a “for cause” in-depth food safety system review. Examples of events that may trigger the State MPI program to conduct a “for cause” indepth food safety system review may include, but are not limited to: • Establishments not in compliance with specific laws and regulations • A positive for STECs in raw ground beef or raw ground beef components • A positive Lm or Salmonella in RTE products or a positive Lm food contact surface sample • A Class I recall or a food safety-related enforcement action (e.g., Notice of Intended Enforcement) that is not the result of an in-depth food safety system review • Establishments that fail Salmonella or Campylobacter performance standards • An establishment that is the supplier of product that tested positive for STECs in raw beef products • Human illness linked to product from a State-regulated establishment • An establishment that has a high level of public health-related Non-compliance Records (NR) 4. State MPI program administrative enforcement action State MPI programs should have procedures in place to initiate enforcement actions, as needed, to ensure food safety compliance. Data Collection The State MPI programs should maintain a system to collect data and facts to support administrative enforcement actions and to track the results of actions taken (e.g., NRs, indepth food safety system reviews, intensified verification testing (IVT), suspensions, and recall information). Data Analysis The State MPI program’s data system should include a mechanism to react to the data collected that support administrative enforcement actions. Examples of events that may trigger the State MPI program to take administrative enforcement actions may include, but are not limited to: • Positive STECs in raw ground beef or raw ground beef components 5', 'January 8, 2015 • Positive Lm, Salmonella, or E. coli O157:H7 in RTE products or a positive Lm food contact surface sample • An establishment which is the supplier of product that tested positive for STECs in raw beef products • Human illness linked to State-regulated product from an establishment (possible recall) • Establishments not in compliance with specific State laws and regulations An explanation of the data system and supporting documents are to be included in the annual State Self-Assessment that is submitted to the Federal State Audit Branch by November 15.
