It replaces the July 2020 version of the guideline. The previous version of the guideline was titled the “FSIS Compliance Guideline for Label Approval.” The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has renamed the guideline the “FSIS Guideline for Label Approval,” so asnotto give the impression thatthe documenthasforce and effectof law. This guideline represents FSIS’ current thinking on these topics and should be considered effectiveas ofits issuance. Establishments that used previous versions of the FSIS Guideline for Label Approval should update their procedures as necessary based on this guideline. For purposes of this document, the term “establishment(s)” includes official meat and poultry establishments and egg products plants, unless otherwise indicated. The information in this guideline is provided to assist establishments in meeting regulatory requirements. The contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public in any way. This document is intended only to provide clarity to industry regarding existing requirements under the regulations. This guideline is focused on small and very small establishments, in support of the Small Business Administration’s initiative to provide small businesses with compliance assistance under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act. However, all establishments may apply the recommendations in this guideline. It is important that small and very small establishments have access to a full range of scientific and technical support, and the assistance needed to label products in compliance with FSIS regulations. Although large establishments can benefit from the information provided, focusing the guideline on the needs of small and very small establishments provides them with assistance that may be otherwise unavailable to them. Congressional Review Act Pursuant to the Congressional Review Act at 5 U.S.C. 801 et seq,the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this guideline is not a “major rule,” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2). Key Point Purpose LPDS only needs to evaluate three types of labels prior to use in commerce (9 CFR 412.1 (c)): This guideline provides information about 1) Labels for religious exempt products 9 CFR the types of labels that must be submitted 412.1 (c) (1). 2) Labels with special statements and claims to LPDS for approval. Specifically, LPDS 9 CFR 412.1 (c) (3). must review three categories of labels 3) Labels for temporary approval 9 CFR 412.1 before they may be used in commerce: (c) (4). labels for religious exempt products (9 CFR 412.1(c)(1)), labels with special statements and claims (9 CFR 412.1(c)(3)), and labels for temporary approval 9 CFR 412.1(c)(4). All other categories of labels are considered “generically approved,” meaning they may be used in commerce without prior review by LPDS provided that they meet all applicable labeling requirements. All labels, including 3', 'generically approved labels, are, subject to routine verification by FSIS field inspectors to ensure ongoing compliance with FSIS labeling requirements. All labels, whether submitted to LPDS for approval or generically approved, are required to comply with all FSIS labeling requirements. To assist establishments with the design and modification of their product labels, this guideline includes specific examples of special statements and claims that must be submitted to LPDS for approval. This guideline also provides examples of: (1) factual statements and claims that are eligible for generic approval, (2) changes that can be made to labels approved with special statements and claims without additional LPDS review, (3) changes that cannot be made to labels approved with special statements and claims without additional LPDS review, (4) blanket label approvals (labels for product line or multiple product lines with identical claims), (5) information about negative claims, (6) information about export labels with deviations from domestic requirements, and ( geographic landmark claims on labels and additional information about label approval. Reason for Reissuing the Guideline FSIS reissued this guideline in response to comments received on the previous version and to improve clarity. This revision also reflects changes to generic labelling approval eligibility established by the final rule, “Prior Label Approval System: Expansion of Generic Label Approval” (88 FR 2798). The final rule expanded generic approval to products only intended for export that deviate from domestic labeling requirements and permitted generic approval of the labels of products that receive voluntary FSIS inspection. It also expanded generic approval to: (1) “organic” claims that appear in a product label’s ingredients statement; (2) “geographic landmarks” displayed on a product label; (3) “negative” claims made on product labels that identify the absence of certain ingredients or types of ingredients. In addition, the final rule announced that LPDS will no longer evaluate generically approved labels voluntarily submitted to LPDS for review. Changes from the Previous Version of the Guideline This guideline, dated January 2023, is final. FSIS will update this guideline, as necessary, should new information become available. This version incorporates the following changes: • The guideline’s title was shortened from the “FSIS Compliance Guideline for Label Approval” to the “FSIS Guideline for Label Approval.” • In the appendices, A bold red asterisk (*) marks new or updated entries to the appendix. Items previously on the list not marked by a bold red asterisk (*) may have been rearranged for ease of readability. A bold plus (+) marks claims that reference a guideline that is hyperlinked at the end of the appendix. A red bold hash (#) marksreference thatthere is additional information aboutthis factual negative statement in Appendix 7. • Appendix 1 now includes new examples of special statements and claims that require LPDS approval before they can be used on labels of product in commerce 4', '(e.g., “natural” and “no animal by-products” claims). Some other types of claims were moved from Appendix 1 to Appendix 2, given they are now eligible for generic approval (e.g., certain negative claims and state endorsement programs that have geographic emblematic design). • Appendix 2 now includes several new factual statements and claims that do not require LPDS approval before they can be used on labels of product in commerce (e.g., “Authentic,” and “Double Smoked”). • Appendix 3 no longer references export labels that deviate from domestic requirements, as those labels are no longer required to be submitted to LPDS for approval. • Appendix 4 no longer includes two examples of export labels, given they are now eligible for generic label approval. • Appendix 5 includes new examples of labels that can be approved as a blanket approval. • Appendix 6 includes new examples of special statements and claims that can be generically approved after receiving the first approval from LPDS. • Appendix 7 has been added to provide information and examples about the types of negative claims that are generically approved. • Appendix 8 has been added to provide information about the generic approval of export labels that deviate from domestic requirements and geographic landmark claims. • Appendix 9 is now entitled “Additional Information for Label Approval,” which was the previous title of Appendix 7. How to Effectively Use the Guideline This guideline is organized to provide users with FSIS’s current thinking on its labeling regulations.

To prevent the introduction of adulterated or misbranded products into commerce, LPDS implements a prior label approval system for labels intended to be used on federally inspected meat, poultry, and egg products, including imported products (9 CFR 412). Without approved labels, meat, poultry, and egg products may not be sold, offered for sale, or otherwise distributed in commerce. Under LPDS’ prior label approval system, there are two types of label approval. First, certain categories of labels must receive “sketch approval” (9 CFR 412.1). To receive sketch approval, establishments must submit a rendering of their label (i.e., a “sketch label) to LPDS for evaluation prior to use in commerce. The sketch label must reasonably represent what the label will ultimately look like but need not be the actual final label applied to the product. Other categories of labels are “generically approved,” meaning they are approvedfor use in commerce without LPDS evaluation so long as they are consistent with FSIS regulations (9 CFR 412.2). Establishments do not need to submit generically approved labels to LPDS for evaluation prior to use so long as they meet all applicable labeling requirements. However, all labels, including generically approved labels are subject to routine verification by FSIS field inspectors. The categories of labels that require sketch approval and, therefore, need to be submitted to LPDS for evaluation are: 1)Labels for religious exempt products 9 CFR 412.1(c) (1); 2)Labels with special statements and claims 9 CFR 412.1 (c) (3); and 3)Labels for temporary approval 9 CFR 412.1(c) (4). Below, there is further discussion about special statements and claims that require submission to LPDS for approval and additional information about generic approval, including: • Special statements and claims that require submission to LPDS; • Factual statements and claims that are generically approved; • Changes that can be made to labels approved with special statements and claims without additional LPDS review; • Changes that cannot be made to labels approved with special statements and claims without additional LPDS review; 7', '• Blanket label approvals (labels for product line or multiple product lines with identical claims); • Special statements and claims that can be generically approved after first approval by LPDS; • Information about negative claims; • Information about export labels with deviations from domestic requirements and geographic landmark claims on labels and; • Additional information about label approval. More information can also be found in each of the appendices summarized below. Special Statements and Claims (9 CFR 412.1 (c) (3)) “Special statements and claims” are claims, logos, trademarks, and other symbols on labels that are generally not defined in FSIS regulations or in the Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book. • An example of a logo or symbol is a graphic representation of a heart. Special statements and claims include “natural” claims, “certified gluten free” claims (e.g., Certified Gluten Free by XYZ entity), health claims, ingredient and processing method claims (e.g., high-pressure processing), claims regarding the raising of animals, organic claims, and instructional or disclaimer statements concerning pathogens (e.g., “for cooking only” or “not tested for E-coli O157:H7”). See Appendix 1 for an expanded list of examples of special statements and claims. Factual Statements and Claims Generically Approved (9 CFR 412.2) FSIS does not consider some factual statements applied to labels to be special statements or claims that require submission to LPDS for approval. Rather, they are statements offactthat mustbe supported in the labeling record.These factual statements are generically approved. • Examples of factual statements in this category include defined geographic styles (e.g., “Italian Style”), “extra” or “more” statements (e.g., “10% more cheese”), geographic landmarks (e.g., Statue of Liberty, maps, flags), organic ingredients listed in the ingredients statement (e.g., organic sugar or organic garlic), and allergen statements (e.g., “contains milk”) consistent with the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act. Most negative claims (e.g., “No Pork”) are also generically approved, including “gluten free” (without an accompanying certification statement) and “no monosodium glutamate (MSG)” or “no MSG added” with appropriate disclaimer statement. However, LPDS evaluation continues to be required for labels that bear negative claims relating to the raising of the animal from which the product is derived (e.g., “no antibiotics administered”) or negative claims relating to the use of genetically modified ingredients. For more information about animal raising claims, see the Labeling Guideline on Documentation Needed to Substantiate Animal Raising Claims for Label Submissions (2019). For more information about negative claims related to the use of genetically modified ingredients, see the Labeling Guideline on 8', 'Statements that Bioengineered or Genetically-Modified Ingredients or Animal Feed were not used in Meat, Poultry of Egg Products. See Appendix 2 for an expanded list of examples of factual statements that are generically approved. Changes to Labels with Approved Special Statements and Claims That Do Not Require Additional LPDS Review Once a label is approved by LPDS for compliance with 9 CFR 412.1, there are several changes that can be made to the label that do not require resubmission to LPDS. These changes are generically approved under 9 CFR 412.2. For such a change to be made, it must be unrelated to the special statement or claim. Some common examples include: • The removal of an ingredient or change in order of predominance of an ingredient in a product formula for a label that was previously approved with a negative claim (e.g., “certified gluten free”). In this case, the removal of an ingredient or change in its order of predominance will not affectthe special statement or claim. • Changing the name of the cut of meat or poultry for a label previously approved with an animal-raising claim (e.g., raised without antibiotics). An example would include changing the name from chicken breast to chicken thigh. The change is generically approved provided the supporting documentation for the chicken is the same as documented in the previously approved label. In this case, changing the name ofthe cutofpoultry willnotaffectthe special statement or claim. • Changing information such as the establishment number (except for products labeled as organic), signature line, preparation instructions, Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points Category, or vignette for a label that was previously approved with a special statement or claim. These changes are generically approved as they will not affectthe special statement or claim. See Appendix 3 for a list of changes to labels with special statements and claims that can be generically approved. Changes to Labels with Approved Special Statements and Claims that Require Additional LPDS Review Sometimes, changes made to a previously approved label with special statements and claims require LPDS approval before the updated label may be used in commerce. Such changes include those that affect the special statement or claim and require LPDS to reevaluate the product formula or other relevant information. Examples include: • A label with a negative claim (e.g., “certified gluten free”) that was previously approved byLPDS. Now,the establishment wants to update its labelto reflectthe use of a new seasoning mix, which includes ingredients that were not in the product formula for the previously approved label. In this case, the establishment is required to resubmit the label to LPDS for approval, so the Agency can verify that the new ingredients do not contain any sources of gluten. • If a company adds an uncured claim to a previously approved label with a “natural” and “certified gluten free” claim, the company must resubmit the label to LPDS for 9', 'approval because it contains a new special statement or claim not included as part of the previous approval. See Appendix 4 for a list of examples of changes to labels with special statements and claims that need to be resubmitted to LPDS. Blanket Label Approvals (Labels for product line or multiple products with identical claims) In some cases, the addition of a special statement or claim to an entire line of products or multiple products will not require every single label to be submitted to LPDS for approval. Instead, establishments may submit a “blanket approval” application to LPDS along with a label for one of the products. The establishment should also include supporting documentation with its application indicating that the establishment is requesting approval for the use of the special statement or claim on multiple product labels. The label application should indicate that the special statement or claim will be added to an entire product line and should specify the product line, or, in the case of only certain labels, the application should list the product labels to which the approval would apply. Some examples include: • An establishment produces 50 different frozen meals. The establishment intends to add a Front of Pack (FOP) statement for all 50 products that will identify the number of calories and grams of protein. In this case, the establishment should not submit 50 applications for different products in a product line for approval. Instead, the establishment should submit an application for blanket approval to LPDS, along with a label for one of the products. The label application should indicate that the FOP statement will be added to all frozen product meals produced at the establishment. The blanket approval will cover products to which the FOP statement is applied so there is no need for each individual label bearing the FOP information to be submitted for approval. The establishment should update the individual nutrient values within the FOP statement generically to match the nutrient values displayed in the nutrition facts panel for each of the meals. However, when a new nutrient is added to the FOP statement, the label can no longer be generically approved (e.g., adding sodium to the statement that already displays the calories and grams of protein). Adding a new nutrient to the FOP statement will require the revised label to be resubmitted to LPDS for evaluation and approval. • An establishment produces X number of organic chicken parts. To obtain approval to label all organic chicken parts with a new claim, such as “no antibiotics,” the establishment should submit one organic chicken breast package with the new “no antibiotic” claim to LPDS. The label application should also include a list of other chicken parts that will also use the new claim. This is a blanket approval because all the parts of the chicken listed in the application will be approved through one label submission. • An establishment has an entire line of beef sausages that LPDS approved with a “certified gluten free” claim. The establishment wants to add a “made with grass fed beef” claim to all the other product labels in the beef sausage product line. Instead of submitting separate applications for each of the individual products, the establishment should submit a request for blanket approval with the 10', 'necessary supporting documentation for the “made with grass-fed beef” claim and a list of all the products in the line. The addition of a “made with grass-fed beef” claim does not affect the previously approved “certified gluten free” claim because there is no change to the ingredients. The addition of the “made with grass-fed beef” claim for products formulated with grass fed beef is a type of claim that can be approved through a request for blanket approval. See Appendix 5 for additional types of special statements and claims that can be approved through a blanket approval. Special Statements and Claims Generically Approved After the First Approval from LPDS There are certain types of special statements and claims that LPDS only needs to see once to ensure compliance with the regulations. After this initial review, the special statements and claims are generically approved for use on any other product produced by the establishment on the condition that future labels using the special statements and claims follow all FSIS requirements and that the special statements and claims are not changed in any way from the initial LPDS approval. Some examples include: • A label that displays a USDA Food Shield was approved for a Chicken Cordon Bleu product. The establishment wants to add the shield to a Chicken Parmesan product as well. Because the establishment has the prior approval from LPDS for the USDA Food shield and has the supporting documentation from the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) on file, the Chicken Parmesan label can be generically approved. This label can be generically approved because the shield was previously approved by LPDS and the label application has the documentation from AMS to support the use of the claim on the label. • A label for chicken hot dogs was approved with a “certified halal” claim. The establishment now wants to make a certified halal chicken sausage. The establishment has the prior approval from LPDS for the certified halal claim and the supporting documentation from the certified Halal organization. This label can be generically approved because the establishment has the certification from the Halal organization that supports the use of the claim on the label. The establishment would need to ensure that the documentation is kept current per FSIS requirements. See Appendix 6 for additional examples. Negative Claims The “negative” claims section provides label examples of ingredient-based claims (e.g., “gluten free without the accompanying certification statement,” “No MSG/No MSG Added [with the accompanying disclaimer statement],” and “no preservatives” that can be generically approved. “Negative” claims are claims made on product labels that identify the absence of certain ingredients or types of ingredients and are generically approved. Negative claims labeling is allowed to indicate the absence of an ingredient when that ingredient is expected or permitted by regulation or policy. This could also apply to ingredients which are not expected or permitted by regulation or policy if the 11', 'ingredients could find their way into the product through a component. For example, the use of “no preservatives” on the label of “spaghetti with meat and sauce” (where regulations do not permit the direct addition of preservatives) would be acceptable if the product contained an ingredient, such as cooking oil, which could contain preservatives but do not. The claims are truthful and not misleading because the ingredients statement provides support that the product does not contain the ingredient. Also in this section are definitions of certain claims such as “No Artificial Flavors,” “No Artificial Colors,” “No Artificial Colors and Flavors,” and “No Artificial Preservatives.” There are sample labels to provide further explanation as to what is allowed on the label with these claims. Labels with negative claims that have animal-raising claims and/or nongenetically modified organisms (non-GMO) claims are not eligible for generic approval. An example of a negative claim that can be generically approved includes: • A label with a gluten free claim. Gluten free highlights the absence of gluten containing ingredients. A claim such as gluten free can be verified by examining the ingredients statement for any gluten-containing ingredients. If the product does contain any gluten containing ingredients, the claim would not be permitted on the label. See Appendix 7 for additional types of negative claims and label examples that can be generically approved. Export Labels that Deviate from Domestic Requirements and Geographic Landmark Claims on Labels The export labels with deviations from domestic requirements section provides information about the documentation and support needed for labels on products that are exported outside of the United States and have deviations from domestic requirements. Such labels must meet the requirements of the importing country, as indicated in the FSIS Export Library. An example of an export label that can be generically approved includes: • Abratwurst label being exported thathas a nutrition factspanelformatthat deviates from United States domestic requirements and the ingredients statement contains incomplete sublists of the ingredients. The label would be acceptable to generically approve as the label complies with the foreign country’s labeling requirements. Documentation supporting the acceptability of the deviation should be kept in the establishment’s labeling records to comply with 9 CFR 320.1(b)(10) and 381.175(b)(6). FSIS inspection program personnel (IPP) verify whether product for export meets requirements listed in the Export Library, including labeling, when certifying products for export. In addition to the information from the Export Library, additional documentation, such as a letter from the importer of record on letterhead, can be used to support that the label is in compliance with importing countries labeling requirements for verification purposes. The geographic landmark claim on labels section provides information about labels that comply with 9 CFR 317.8 (b) (1) or 9 CFR 381.129 (b) (2), the state endorsement programs that have a geographic emblematic design, state endorsement programs that do not have a geographic emblematic design, and geographic style documentation by 12', 'third-party authority claims on labels. There is also a list of the geographic claims on labels that are found in the Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book. An example of a geographic landmark claim that can be generically approved includes: • A label with a Go Texan with a map of Texas on the label can be generically approved and there needs to be support in the labeling record that the product complies with the Go Texan requirements. The support can be a certificate for being a member of the Go Texan program or a letter from the certifying entity stating the label is compliant with their requirements. The documentation should be updated once a year to remain compliant. See Appendix 8 for additional information about export labels that deviate from domestic requirements and geographic landmark claims that can be generically approved. Additional Information for Label Approval Appendix 9 provides general information about label approval and information about the other categories of labels (i.e., labels for temporary approval, including label transfers, and labels for product produced under religious exemption) that must be evaluated by LPDS prior to entering commerce.

be generically approved provided they do not fall into any of the categories of the labels that must be evaluated by LPDS. Included in that group of labels are those labels that have a special statement or claim that were previously approved by LPDS. Thus, once a label is approved there are several changes that can be made to the label that do not impact the previously approved claims. These revisions do not impact the previously approved special statement or claim. In addition, for the additional changes to be generically approved, there cannot be any formulation changes or addition of ingredients that were not part of the previously approved label. For more in-depth explanation see discussion on page 9. Examples of the types of label changes permitted are: • Additional cooking instructions, e.g., the label originally includes cooking instructions for a conventional oven but now the establishment is adding instructions for a microwave. • Addition of a bar code • Addition of a brand name or changes to a brand name that do not include a new claim • Addition of defined nutrition claim • Addition of Julian date • Adding new establishments for certification claims that cover multiple establishments • Addition of a flag that would have to be associated with “made in USA,” or “product of USA”. However, this change must follow the requirements of 9 CFR 317.8 (b) (2). • Addition of a flag, map, or geographic emblem without including emblem “brand 21', 'made in” • Addition of e-mail address or website information • Addition of a logo or changes to a logo that does not include a new claim* • Addition of a “non-GMO or “non-GE” claim to a certified organic label. For more information see Labeling Guideline on Statements that Bioengineered or Genetically Modified Ingredients or Animal Feed Were Not Used in Meat, Poultry or Egg Products. • Addition ofa nutrition facts panel • Addition of a scan code app or QR (quick response) code • Addition of geographic style to product names, e.g., Tuscan Style to a previously approved Italian Sausage label. When not an established style in the regulations or Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book, the third-party authority documentation must be included as part of the labeling record. • Addition of a universal product code (UPC code) • Additional meat orpoultry cutnot on the previous listof cutsapproved exceptfor organic claims • Addition of trademark that does not impact previously approved special statement or claim and does not add a new special statement or claim* • Changes to the ad copy that does not include an additional claim that was not present on the previously approved label and does not conflict with the current claims on the label • Changing an approved claim to a synonymous claim (e.g., changing from “no antibiotics used” to “raised without antibiotics”) • Changes to comply with Descriptive Designation for Raw Meat and Poultry Products Containing Added Solutions (9 CFR 317.2(e)(2) and 9 CFR 381.117(h)) • Changes to comply with Descriptive Designation for Needle-or Blade-tenderized Beef Products(9 CFR 317.2(e)(3)) • Changes to the cooking instructions provided it still complies with the requirements of the corresponding HACCP category • Changes to the descriptive name • Changes to the design of the label including layout. The establishment has the responsibility to ensure that all mandatory features are still in the required location. • Changes to the design of the label including the layout to labels for export with deviations from domestic requirements. The establishment has the responsibility to ensure that all mandatory features are still in the required location and no new label deviations were created. • Changes to an e-mail address or website that was on previously approved label • Changes to the establishment number or legend except for organic product. (Changes to the establishment number for organic product must be evaluated by LPDS.) • Changes to the form of the product (e.g., changing from link sausage to bulk sausage or changing from sausage patties to sausage links)* • Changes to the HACCP category (e.g., change from raw product ground to fully cooked not shelf stable) • Changes to the handling statement (e.g., keep refrigerated) 22', '• Changes to the label for compliance with the added solutions regulations (9 CFR 317.2 (e) and 9 CFR 381.117). • Changes to names of ingredients in the ingredients statement provided the addition complies with FDA or FSIS labeling policies • Changes to the net weight, including the addition of net weight labels (e.g., a label was approved for 1 pound (lb.) and the new label is for 2 pounds (lbs.) • Changes to the order ofpredominance or productformula without the addition of new ingredients • Changes to the packaging (e.g., going from plastic container to plastic bag) • Changes to the placement or location of the legend • Changes to the product name (e.g., changing the product name from sausage to Italian sausage provided it meets the regulation and/or standards) • Changes to the signature line (e.g., manufactured for or distributed by) • Changes to values in the nutrition factspanel • Changing from “GE to “GMO” on certified organic or other third-party certified labels. For more information see Labeling Guideline on Statements that Bioengineered or Genetically Modified Ingredients or Animal Feed Were Not Used in Meat, Poultry or Egg Products • Removal of ingredients in product without the addition of new ingredients • Removal of nutrition front of pack icon. The addition of an icon that was not previously evaluated by LPDS would need to be submitted for approval. • Removal of previously approved claim. Appendix 4: Changes to labels with special statements and claims that require LPDS review 9 CFR 412.1 states that certain changes to labels are not permitted to be made generically. The labels must be submitted to LPDS for approval. For more in-depth explanation see discussion on page 9. Examples on the types of label changes that cannot be made generically include: • Addition of additional nutrients to the labels with nutrition front of pack (FOP) statement • Addition of an animal-raising claim • Addition of ingredients to labels with special statement and claims such as “Natural,” “Organic,” and “Certified Gluten Free” • Change to the establishment number on labels with an organic claim • Change to the ingredients without changing the label. That would require a temporary approval from LPDS • Changing the organic certifier on an approved label 23', 'Appendix 5: Blanket Label Approvals (Product Line or Multiple Products with Identical Claims) A Blanket Approval refers to an approval that would cover multiple products or product lines that is submitted to LPDS for approval because it falls under one or more of the four categories of labels described in 9 CFR 412.1. For more in-depth explanation see discussion on page 10. Examples of labels that can be approved as a blanket approval: • Addition of animal-production claim to line that also bears an ingredient-related claim • Addition of FOP statements to multiple products in the same product line or company • Addition of a new supplier for an approved animal- production claim • AMS processing extra regulatory marking or verification programs* • Changing the organic certifier on an approved label • Changing the source of meat from a previously approved label when the claims and ingredients have not changed from the prior approval • High pressure processed at establishment ABC • Religious exempt products* • USDA Contract Compliance (AMS program)* • USDA Food Shield (AMS program)* • USDA Further Processed Certification Program (AMS Program)* Appendix 6: Special Statements and Claims Generically Approved After the First Approval from LPDS There are certain types of special statements and claims for which LPDS only needs to see one label to ensure compliance with the regulations and after that initial approval, the label can be generically approved for additional products. This is provided that any future labels follow all FSIS rules, policies, and regulations. The establishment would also have to include a copy of the initial approval in their labeling record to provide assurance that the special statement or claim did initially receive approval from LPDS. If the special statement or claim has changed at all from the initial LPDS approval, the new label must be submitted to LPDS for evaluation. For more in-depth explanation see discussion on page 11. A bold red asterisk (*) marks new or updated entries to the appendix. Items previously on the list not marked by a bold red asterisk (*) may have been rearranged for ease of readability. Examples of labels that can be generically approved after initial LPDS approval: • AMS processing extra regulatory marking or verification programs* 24', '• Nutrition FOP—provided the format,location and nutrients remain identical to the initial approval. If the establishment changes the format, location, or nutrients, then the new label must be evaluated by LPDS • Certified Halal/Certified Zabihah Halal- must have documentation in the labeling record current within the last year to support the use of the claim • Certified Kosher- must have documentation in the labeling record current within the last year to support the use of the claim • Certified Women’s Business Enterprise • Employee Owned Certified • FDA nutrition facts panel- one approvalfromLPDS performat (e.g., full format, simplified, linear, tabular, dual column, or aggregate format) • For cooking only at establishment xyz- must have documentation in the labeling record to support that the product is being sent to another establishment for cooking • High pressure processed at establishment ABC • Sustainable Forestry Initiative Certified Sourcing • USDA Contract Compliance (AMS program)* • USDA Food Shield (AMS program)* • USDA Further Processed Certification Program (AMS Program)* Appendix 7: Negative Claims Negative claims are claims that state a product does not contain a certain ingredient . Negative claims can be generically approved per 9 CFR 412.2 (b). Examples of negative claims include gluten free, no artificial colors, no artificial flavors, no artificial preservatives, no MSG, no MSG added, no nitrites and nitrates, no nitrites and nitrates added and no preservatives. • Gluten Free is a negative claim that highlights the absence of certain glutencontaining ingredients in the ingredients statement. FSIS does not define gluten free in its regulations but applies FDA’s requirements for the voluntary use of the claim in 21 CFR 101.91. A claim of “gluten free” is generically approved unless it is a certified claim, e.g., “Certified Gluten Free by (XYZ entity).” Certified gluten-free claims need to be submitted to LPDS for approval with support for the claim. See the sample label below for a gluten-free label claim that can be generically approved. 25', 'Made with beef, pork and chicken Ingredient~: Beef, pork, chicken, salt, spices, flavors, sodium nitrate, sodium phosphate, sea salt. NET WT. 7 oz (198g) Gluten Free • No Artificial Colors is a negative claim that follows the entry in the Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book that the product doesn’t contain any artificial colors as defined therein: Labels of products that are artificially colored either by artificial colors or natural colors must bear a statement to indicate the presence of the coloring, for example, “artificially colored” or “colored with annatto.” Products whose true color is disguised by packing media, for example, colored pickling solutions, must also have labels that include a statement that indicates the presence of the color. The statement must appear in a prominent and conspicuous manner contiguous to the product name. When a component within a product is artificially colored, for example, breading, sauce, and sausage, a qualifying statement is not necessary. However, in all cases, the presence of the coloring must appear in the ingredients statement. Common artificial colors are FD&C Yellow No. 5 or Yellow No. 5, Red Dye No. 40, FD&C Red No. 3, FD&C Green No. 3, and FD&C Blue No. 2. 21 CFR Part 73 lists color additives that are exempt from certification. Colors that are exempt from certification are not required to be declared by common or usual name on labels and may be declared as “colorings” or “color added.” Examples of exempt colors include Annatto extract, Caramel, and Paprika oleoresin. In comparison, certified colors are listed in 21 CFR Part 74 and are required to be declared by common or usual name, e.g., FD&C Blue No. 1, FD&C Blue No 2, FD&C Green No. 3, FD&C Red No. 3, FD&C Red No. 40, FD&C Yellow No. 5, FD&C Yellow No. 6, Orange B, Citrus Red No. 2. • No Artificial Flavors is a negative claim that describes a product that contains no ingredients labeled as artificial flavors (e.g., Artificial Maple Flavor). Acceptable ingredients can include MSG,smoke flavor, flavors, naturalflavors, disodium 26', \"Skinless C hie ken Breast No Artificial Colors or Flavors KEEP REFRIGERATED NET WT. 48 OZ (3 LB) Safe Handling Instructions This prcxfuct was prepared from inspected and passed meat and/ or poultry.

See the sample label below for a no artificial colors or flavors label that can be generically approved. • No artificial preservatives mean the product would not contain any source of artificial preservative. LPDS has allowed the claim of no artificial preservatives under the following conditions so the consumer is not misled about whether the products is preserved or not. The labeling claim would consist of: 1. A statement “See back panel for ingredients used to preserve quality” would appear on the front panel in immediate proximity to the “No Artificial Preservatives” claim. This will provide consumers with details about the claim-namely, the fact that the product has added ingredients that will help preserve product quality. 2.

The asterisk would lead to the following explanatory statement below the ingredient line: “Ingredient to preserve quality” or perhaps a shortened form like “to preserve quality.” See sample label below for no artificial preservatives claim that can be generically approved. 27\", \"FULLY COOKED No Artificial Preservatives See back panel for ingredients used to preserve quality Chicken Nuggets BREADED ST AR SHAPED CHICKEN BREAST WITH RIB MEAT KEEP FROZEN NET WT. 5 LBS (2.26kg) Pepperoni Ingredients: Beef, por1<, chicken, salt, spices, flavors, sodium phosphate, sea salt.

No MSG • No MSG is a negative claim that means the product does not contain any sources of MSG. Common sources of MSG include any ingredient that is hydrolyzed or autolyzed such as autolyzed yeast extract. Other common sources of MSG are Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce. For a label that claims No MSG and does have a natural source of MSG, the claim would need to be changed to No MSG added with a disclaimer statement (see the next section for additional information). See sample label below for No MSG claims that can be generically approved. 28\", 'Made with beef, pork and chicken Ingredients: Beef, pork, chicken, salt, spices, flavors, sodium nitrate, sodium phosphate, sea salt, autolyzed yeast extract.

Other common ingredients include any ingredient that is hydrolyzed or autolyzed such as autolyzed yeast extract. For labels with this claim, it would need to state No MSG Added* and then have a corresponding asterisk on the same panel with the *except for that naturally occurring and identify the ingredients in the product that are the naturally occurring sources of MSG, e.g., “No MSG Added* *except for that naturally occurring in autolyzed yeast extract and Worcestershire sauce.” The disclaimer statement must be on the same panel as the claim. See sample label below for no MSG added claim that can be generically approved. • No Nitrites and Nitrates is a negative claim that means that the product would have no natural sources of nitrites, nitrates, or nitrites and nitrates (e.g., sea salt, cultured celery powder, celery powder, cultured celery juice or celery juice). Products labeled as uncured would need to follow the 9 CFR 317.17 requirements.

FSIS regulations provide for deviations from domestic labeling requirements for products for export with deviations from domestic requirements under 9 CFR 317.7 and 9 CFR 381.128. Export labels that deviate from U.S. domestic requirements are approved generically provided the labeling deviations comply with the importing country’s labeling requirements. Documentation supporting the acceptability of the deviation should be kept in the establishment’s labeling records under 9 CFR 320.1(b)(11) and 381.175(b)(6). FSIS maintains an Export Library that lists requirements for exported products that foreign authorities have officially communicated to FSIS, including labeling requirements. At times, foreign country labeling requirements conflict with domestic requirements. FSIS regulations (9 CFR 317.7 and 9 CFR 381.128) permit export product labels to deviate from FSIS’ domestic labeling requirements to comply with foreign country requirements or to be marketed more easily in a foreign country. Although there is no specific equivalent regulation for egg products, FSIS follows the same policy because such products, intended exclusively for export, must comply with foreign countries’ requirements and are therefore not considered misbranded. FSIS IPP verify whether product for export meets requirements listed in the Export Library, including labeling, when certifying products for export. 32\", 'The FSIS Export Library is a resource published by the agency for information on various countries importing requirements. In addition to the information in the Export Library, types of documentation typically used to support labeling deviations include a letter from theimporter onits officialletterhead, a letter fromthegovernmentofthe importing country, and excerpts from the importing country’s regulations or laws, provided the source of the information can be verified by IPP e.g., a link to a government site listing officialregulations. The information in the label record helps verify that the label complies with the importing country’s requirements. Geographic Landmark Claims on Labels: “Geographic landmarks” are claims displayed on a product label, such as a foreign country’s flag, monument, or map. For example, the following claims displayed on a productlabel no longer require LPDS review prior to entering commerce:a Polish flag depicted on a Polish sausage product label, or an outline of the State of Nevada depicted on a product label for beef produced in Nevada. There are several types of geographic landmark claims, including labels that comply with 9 CFR 317.8(b)(1) or 9 CFR 381.129(b), other options for geographic naming, state endorsement programs that have a geographic emblematic design, state endorsement programs that do not have a geographic emblematic design, and geographic style documentation by third-party authority. Labels that comply with 9 CFR 317.8 (b) (1) or 9 CFR 381.129 (b) (2) requirements: For labels that comply with 9 CFR 317.8 (b) (1) or 9 CFR 381.129 (b) (2), the product would need to be labeled as e.g., “Tuscan Brand Made in USA” or follow one of the established styles in the Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book (e.g., “Italian Style”). Other options for geographic naming to comply with 9 CFR 317.8 (b) (1) or 9 CFR 381.129 (b) (2) include e.g., “Tuscan Inspired,” “Tuscan Recipe Chicken,” or “Chicken Tuscan.” For a list of the established styles in the Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book, see the end of this appendix, if the style in question is not in this list, the label would need to comply with the requirements in 9 CFR 317.8 (b) (1), 9 CFR 381.129 (b) (2) or follow the third-party authority documentation requirement State endorsement programs that have a geographic emblematic design (e.g., Wisconsin Cheese with a map of Wisconsin or use of flag): State endorsement programs that have a geographic emblematic design (e.g., Go Texan with the map of Texas or Nevada Made with the map of Nevada) and a geographic logo, map or flag are generically approved per 9 CFR 412.2 (b). The label must comply with 9 CFR 317.8 (b) (1), 9 CFR 381.129 (b) (2) or an established style in the Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book. In addition, there must be support in the labeling record for the claim. The support can be a certificate fromthe agency running the certification program or a letter stating the label complies with the requirements. The supporting documentation needs to be updated yearly. 33', 'State Endorsement Programs that do not have a geographic emblematic design: For the state endorsement programs that do not have a geographic emblematic design (e.g., “Pride of New York,” “Kentucky Proud”), there needs to be support in the labeling record for the claim. The support can be a certificate from the agency running the certification program or a letter stating the label complies with the requirements. The supporting documentation needs to be updated yearly. Geographic Style Documentation by Third-Party Authority: New geographic styles, not listed in the Food Standards or Labeling Policy Book, for example, “Laos Style,” must be supported by a third-party authority. The third-party authority could be a chef or other culinary authority providing a definition for the style and stating how the product meets that definition. The geographic style documentation by a third-party authority must: • Indicate the type of product as identified with and peculiar to the area represented by the geographical term. • Indicate the characteristics of the X style in a manner that is quick and easy to understand. It may be a method of preparation and/or certain ingredients that are used. • Have characteristics that are unique to the geographical style for which the documentation is being provided; and • Provide the credentials of the person who is claiming to be the third-party authority. Further, unless the new style is documented in the Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book, the company needs to include supporting information in every labeling record that is generically approved and with every label that is submitted for approval. Documentation requirements for Geographic Landmark Claims: The documentation for a geographic claim on a label must be updated once a year and be current for that year. The documentation to support the claim for a state endorsement program and state endorsement program with geographic emblematic design can be a certificate from a state agency. For the third-party authority, you need to have the supporting documentation and/or certificate updated once a year from the third-party authority to support the claim. Styles defined in the Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book • Asian Style • Country Style • Buffalo Style • Cajun Style/Cajun Recipe • Cantonese Style Spices • Creole Style • Italian Style (please note- Italian Style sausage must meet 9 CFR 319.145) 34', '•Jamaican Style •Jerk or Jerk Style •Hawaiian Style •Mediterranean Style •Mexican Style •Nacho Style, Nacho Flavor and Similar Terms •New Orleans Style •Oriental Style •Santa Fe Style •Southwestern Style •Szechwan Style •Thai Style Appendix 9: Additional Information for Label Approval This section provides additional information about the two other categories of labels that LPDS must evaluate. Also, the following provides some general information about label requirements. Labels for religious exempt products (9 CFR 412.1 (c)(1)): Poultry slaughtered under Buddhist, Confucian, Halal, or Kosher religious exemptions may not bear the mark of inspection. Because of this, the labels deviate from labeling requirements and must be approved by LPDS. For more information see Religious Exemption for the Slaughter and Processing of Poultry. Labels for temporary approval (9 CFR 412.1 (c)(4)): A temporary label approval may be granted for labels with a regulatory deviation that does not pose any potential health, safety,or dietary problems to the consumer. Temporary approvals will be granted for up to 180 days, and establishments can apply for one extension of up to an additional 180 days. Label transfers are a special type of temporary approval which is granted for 60 days with one additional extension. Temporary label approval is granted on a case-by-case basis. Example: A supplier changes ingredients and fails to inform the establishment, and the establishment needs to make a minor correction to the ingredients statement. The establishment can apply for a temporary approval to use the existing label, even though it does not have the correct ingredients statement. Only LPDS can grant temporary approvals for labels with deficiencies. The submitter must address the four conditions for temporary approval listed in 9 CFR 412.1(f) and explain how they meet each condition. As part of their label application, they must also explain exactly what is wrong with their label. Example: A change in the ingredients statement from what was approved in the past. The submitter would submit both ingredients statements and highlight the differences between them. FSIS Verification Activities at Establishments 35', 'FSIS IPP perform routine and directed General Labeling Tasks as assigned by the Public Health Inspection System as part of their regular label verification activities under FSIS Directive 7221.1, Prior Label Approval. FSIS IPP verify that final labels applied to final product follow applicable regulations by evaluating information in the establishment’s labeling record and the label that is applied to the product (e.g., to verify that the ingredients statement on the label matches the product formula). Neither establishments, LPDS, nor FSIS inspectors generically approve labels. Rather, such labels are approved by the regulations provided they follow applicable requirements in 9 CFR 412.2 (b). For additional information, see FSIS Directive 7221.1, Prior Labeling Approval. Labeling and Establishment Responsibilities concerning Label Approval Establishments are required to keep records of all labeling, both generically approved, and sketch approved by LPDS, along with the product formulation and processing procedures, as prescribed in 9 CFR 320.1(b)(11), 9 CFR 381.175(b)(6), and 9 CFR 412.1. For labels that are sketch modified by LPDS, the establishment is responsible for making the changes on the label as noted by LPDS, prior to the final generic label approval and printing. For establishments that are making changes to labels previously approved by LPDS, they must update the labeling records and label to reflect the changes made. If the label has claims that are impacted by the ingredients, then the label would need to be resubmitted to LPDS for approval prior to use. 9 CFR 412.1(a) added the requirement that any additional documentation needed to support that the labels are consistent with the Federal meat and poultry regulations on labeling also be kept. For example, in a situation where an establishment is making an undefined geographic claim on a label (“Tuscan style”), documentation should be included to support that the style meets 9 CFR 317.8 (b). Companies must provide labeling records to FSIS personnel upon request as described in 9 CFR 412.1(a).
