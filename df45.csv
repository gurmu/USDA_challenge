Introduction This is the first edition of the FSIS Compliance Guide for a Systematic Approach to the Humane Handling of Livestock. FSIS developed this guide to promote a systematic approach to achieve compliance with the 9 CFR Part 313 regulatory requirements for humane handling and slaughter of livestock. The guide also provides a sample humane handling plan and an assessment tool. FSIS is committed to providing establishments the best assistance possible. FSIS believes that a well-implemented systematic approach for humane handling is the best way to achieve the best practices for humane handling and slaughter of livestock. This guide describes a systematic approach that FSIS believes represents the current best practices. This guide does not include all items that could be included in an establishment's development and implementation of a systematic approach to humane handling and should not serve to limit the design of a systematic approach. The guide is simply a starting point for those establishments needing guidance and assistance in establishing a systematic approach. Background In the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act (HMSA), Congress declared that humane handling and slaughter of livestock was public policy.1 The HMSA states, “that the use of humane methods in the slaughter of livestock prevents needless suffering; results in safer and better working conditions for persons engaged in the slaughtering industry; brings about improvement of products and economies in slaughtering operations; and produces other benefits for producers, processors, and consumers which tend to expedite an orderly flow of livestock and livestock products in interstate and foreign commerce.” Congress amended the HMSA in 1978 to provide USDA the authority to inspect slaughterhouses for compliance with the HMSA and to penalize violators. The HMSA is referenced in the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) (21 USC 6032) and is implemented by FSIS humane handling and slaughter regulations found in 9 CFR Part 313. The FMIA provides that, for the purposes of preventing inhumane slaughter of 1 7 USC 1901 - It is therefore declared to be the policy of the United States that the slaughtering of livestock and the handling of livestock in connection with slaughter shall be carried out only by humane methods. 2 21 USC 603(b) - For the purpose of preventing the inhumane slaughtering of livestock, the Secretary shall cause to be made, by inspectors appointed for that purpose, an examination and inspection of the method by which amenable species are slaughtered and handled in connection with slaughter in the slaughtering establishments inspected under this chapter. The Secretary may refuse to provide inspection to a new slaughtering establishment or may cause inspection to be temporarily suspended at a slaughtering establishment if the Secretary finds that any cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, or other equines have been slaughtered or handled in connection with slaughter at such establishment by any method not in accordance with the Act of August 27, 1958 (72 Stat. 862; 7 USC 1901–1906) until the establishment furnishes assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that all slaughtering and handling in connection with slaughter of livestock shall be in accordance with such a method. KEY INFORMATION What is a systematic approach to humane handling? With a systematic approach, establishments focus on treating livestock in such a manner as to minimize excitement, discomfort, and accidental injury the entire time they hold livestock in connection with slaughter."", 'FSIS Compliance Guide for a Systematic Approach to the Humane Handling of Livestock Page 5 of 21 IS POULTRY SLAUGHTER INCLUDED IN THE SYSTEMATIC APPROACH? No, however, the PPIA (Poultry Products Inspection Act) and Agency regulations (9 CFR Part 381.65(b)) do require that live poultry be handled in a manner that is consistent with good commercial practices, and that they not die from causes other than slaughter (Good Commercial Practices and the Federal Register Notice). (Note: The Federal Register Notice referenced here includes guidelines rather than regulatory requirements.) livestock, the Secretary of Agriculture will assign inspectors to examine and inspect the methods by which livestock are handled and slaughtered in connection with slaughter in establishments subject to inspection (21 USC 603(b)). Therefore, establishments are required to meet the humane handling and slaughter requirements in the regulations the entire time they hold livestock in connection with slaughter. On September 9, 2004, FSIS announced that livestock slaughter establishments should implement and maintain a systematic approach to humane handling and slaughter to best assure compliance with the HMSA, FMIA, and implementing regulations (69 Federal Register 54625). A systematic approach is a comprehensive way of evaluating how livestock enter and move through an establishment. Implementing a systematic approach is not a regulatory requirement. FSIS presents the systematic approach as the best way to ensure that establishments meet the requirements of the HMSA, FMIA, and implementing regulations. The 2004 notice outlined four recommended steps establishments should take to develop and maintain a systematic approach. When using the recommended systematic approach, establishments would take into account any new conditions in the establishment that warrant changes to facilities or existing handling or slaughter procedures. The four steps are presented in the section entitled Systematic Approach versus Robust Systematic Approach (page 6). In August 2011, FSIS issued FSIS Directive 6900.2 Humane Handling and Slaughter of Livestock – Revision 2. The directive included instructions for inspectors to determine whether livestock slaughter establishments have a robust systematic approach to humane handling. Establishments may choose to adopt a robust approach, although it is not required. For FSIS to consider a systematic approach to be robust, the Agency expects that the systematic approach will include a written animal handling program and program records. The records need to be available for FSIS review. If an establishment develops and implements a robust systematic approach to humane handling and slaughter, FSIS would consider this when determining enforcement actions following an egregious inhumane treatment event. Overview of Humane Handling and Slaughter of Livestock Humane handling and slaughter of livestock prevents needless suffering; results in safer and better working conditions within the slaughtering industry; improves products and slaughtering operations; and produces other benefits for producers, processors, and consumers. KEY DEFINITION Egregious inhumane treatment: An egregious situation is any act or condition that results in severe harm to animals (FSIS Directive 6900.2 Revision 2).', 'FSIS Compliance Guide for a Systematic Approach to the Humane Handling of Livestock Page 6 of 21 Humane handling requirements involve handling facilities and equipment, personnel practices, and slaughter equipment. Handling facilities and equipment are addressed in 9 CFR 313.1. Personnel practices are addressed in 9 CFR 313.2. Slaughter equipment is addressed in 9 CFR 313.5, 9 CFR 313.15, 9 CFR 313.16, and 9 CFR 313.30. FSIS Verification of Establishment Humane Handling Activities FSIS veterinarians and other trained Inspection Program Personnel (IPP) perform humane handling verification activities when establishments slaughter animals, or when animals are on inspected premises (FSIS Directive 6900.2 Revision 2). To verify compliance with 9 CFR Part 313, IPP make verification observations during the course of their inspection duties. FSIS records the time spent performing verification activities in the Humane Activities Tracking System (HATS). The nine HATS categories (see text box) address all of the regulations covering the humane handling and slaughter of livestock. IPP verify specific facility, handling, or slaughter requirements for each of the categories. The table in Attachment 1 identifies each HATS category and the verification activities IPP perform. Systematic Approach versus Robust Systematic Approach A systematic approach to humane handling and slaughter takes the regulatory requirements in 9 CFR Part 313 and organizes them into a logical approach, marked by attention to detail, regular implementation, and tailoring to the operation of the establishment. Developing a systematic approach to humane handling and slaughter is the first step in ensuring that the establishment complies with the applicable humane handling and slaughter requirements. FSIS believes that the following four elements represent a systematic approach to humane handling and slaughter of livestock. Under a SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO HUMANE HANDLING AND SLAUGHTER, establishments should 1. Assess the ability of their livestock handling and slaughter practices to minimize distress and injury to livestock. 2. Design facilities and implement handling practices that minimize distress and injury to livestock. 3. Periodically evaluate facilities and handling methods to ensure that they continue to minimize distress and injury to livestock. 4. When necessary, modify facilities and handling methods to ensure that they continue to minimize distress and injury to livestock. WHAT ARE THE HATS CATEGORIES? I. Inclement Weather II. Truck Unloading III. Water and Feed Availability IV. Ante-mortem Inspection V. Suspect and Disabled VI. Electric Prod/Alternative Object Use VII. Slips and Falls VIII. Stunning Effectiveness IX. Conscious Animals on the Rail', 'FSIS Compliance Guide for a Systematic Approach to the Humane Handling of Livestock Page 7 of 21 A robust systematic approach to humane handling and slaughter adds to the four elements by incorporating three additional features (Table 1). Those three features are: 1) WRITTEN PROCEDURES: − Describes procedures that the establishment will effectively implement to stay in compliance with the regulations. − Describes actions the establishment will take when it fails to implement the program as written or fails to prevent a noncompliance. 2) WRITTEN RECORDS: − Maintains records that demonstrate that the program is implemented as written. − Maintains records that demonstrate the program will effectively prevent identified potential noncompliances. 3) FSIS REVIEW: − Written procedures and records are both made available for FSIS review upon request. KEY INFORMATION How do I demonstrate that I have a systematic approach? The basic (non-robust) systematic approach does not include a written program or records. FSIS evaluates an establishment’s systematic approach through observation of operations and discussion of humane handling with establishment personnel. The four elements of the systematic approach cover several topics. This set of questions can help determine whether the establishment has a systematic approach to humane handling and slaughter. To demonstrate working knowledge of humane handling issues, establishments should be able to discuss their approach to humane handling and slaughter by answering these questions. − What situations may result in livestock excitement, discomfort, or accidental injury? − What situations may result in stunning problems? − Is the livestock handling facility designed for the movement and holding of livestock? − Does the establishment implement the livestock handling practices as designed? − How often are livestock handling methods evaluated? − How do you evaluate the stunning methods? − How do you deal with problems with livestock handling and stunning practices? − How do you know your actions have solved or lessened the problem? − How and with what information do you train employees?', 'FSIS Compliance Guide for a Systematic Approach to the Humane Handling of Livestock Page 8 of 21 Table 1: Systematic Approach versus Robust Systematic Approach Assessment Design Facilities and Practices Periodic Evaluation Modification (as needed) Written Procedures Written Records FSIS Review Systematic Approach Yes Yes Yes Yes No No No Robust Systematic Approach Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes FSIS believes that developing a written plan is a step toward a robust systematic approach to humane handling and slaughter because a written plan can effectively address the four aspects of a systematic approach. The Sample EST 38 Humane Handling and Slaughter Plan (attachment 3) provides basic features of a written program with records. The following table identifies the differences between the systematic approach and the robust systematic approach. FSIS Response to Egregious Inhumane Treatment When humane handling or slaughter noncompliance occurs, 9 CFR 500.2(a)(4) authorizes FSIS to take a regulatory control action, and 9 CFR 500.3(b) authorizes FSIS to suspend inspection without prior notification (Notice of Suspension). Although FSIS is authorized to suspend inspection without prior notification, FSIS may exercise enforcement discretion by providing an establishment prior notification (Notice of Intended Enforcement, 9 CFR 500.4) and an opportunity to implement necessary corrective actions to achieve humane handling compliance. FSIS Directive 6900.2 (Revision 2) instructs FSIS personnel on how to respond to egregious inhumane treatment. The action FSIS personnel will take when egregious inhumane treatment occurs is likely to vary depending on whether the following conditions exist in the establishment: a) The establishment does not have any recent humane handling related enforcement actions. b) The establishment has consistently been meeting the humane handling regulatory requirements. c) The establishment has been operating under a written animal handling program that is a robust systematic approach and the establishment has made the written program accessible to IPP. d) The establishment has demonstrated the robustness of the program to IPP by effectively and consistently implementing all aspects of its program. In establishments without a robust systematic approach to humane handling and slaughter, or when not all of the conditions (a. through d.) provided above exist, FSIS instructs IPP to take the following action:', 'FSIS Compliance Guide for a Systematic Approach to the Humane Handling of Livestock Page 9 of 21 • In the case of humane handling or slaughter noncompliance with egregious inhumane treatment, the inspector in charge recommends issuance of a Notice of Suspension. In establishments maintaining a robust systematic approach to humane handling and slaughter, and when the conditions (a. through d.) provided above exist, FSIS instructs inspection program personnel to take the following action. • In the case of humane handling or slaughter noncompliance with egregious inhumane treatment – the inspector in charge recommends issuance of a Notice of Intended Enforcement rather than a Notice of Suspension. NOTE: 9 CFR Part 500 – Rules of Practice defines suspension as “an interruption in the assignment of program employees to all or part of an establishment,” and 9 CFR Part 500.3 (b) gives FSIS the authority to impose a suspension without providing establishments prior notification for handling or slaughtering animals inhumanely; that is, the stunning and slaughter of livestock stops while under a suspension. FSIS may “impose a suspension after an establishment is provided prior notification and the opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance” (9 CFR Part 500.4). FSIS acts on this authority by issuing a Notice of Intended Enforcement. Establishment’s in receipt of a Notice of Intended Enforcement are afforded time (up to 3 days) to demonstrate or achieve compliance. If the establishment does not demonstrate or achieve compliance in 3 days, FSIS issues a Notice of Suspension.', 'FSIS Compliance Guide for a Systematic Approach to the Humane Handling of Livestock Page 10 of 21 Creating a Robust Systematic Humane Handling and Slaughter Plan Step 1: Conduct an assessment FSIS believes that an assessment is the best first step toward a robust systematic approach to humane handling and slaughter. FSIS considers an assessment robust if it takes into consideration the establishment’s entire humane handling and slaughter infrastructure. An assessment of humane handling and slaughter determines whether any component of the establishment’s infrastructure has the potential to result in inhumane handling or slaughter of livestock. The Code of Federal Regulations (9 CFR Part 313) describes three general categories of infrastructure, 1) livestock facilities, 2) personnel practices, and 3) slaughter equipment. − Livestock facilities include the following components. • Vehicles and trailers used to transport livestock. • Facilities and equipment through which livestock pass as they move from transport vehicles or trailers to holding facilities, between holding facilities, and from holding facilities to restraining devices. • Facilities used to hold livestock temporarily. • Facilities and equipment used to restrict livestock movement during slaughter. − Personnel practices address the knowledge, skills, and abilities of any person handling livestock on the official premise. − Slaughter equipment includes the equipment used to render livestock insensible to pain and induce death. The Humane Methods of Slaughter Act describes two methods of slaughter found to be humane. • Render insensible to pain by a single blow3 or gunshot4 or by electrical stunning,5 chemical exposure 6 or other means7. • Slaughter in accordance with the ritual requirements of a religious faith. To facilitate an assessment, FSIS is providing a sample assessment tool for humane handling and slaughter in Attachment 2 of this document. The tool contains all humane handling requirements as statements. The assessor decides if each statement is true, false, or does not apply to the establishment. The assessor should check “True” if the item does not have the potential to result in inhumane handling or slaughter of livestock. The assessor should check “False” if the item has the potential to result in inhumane handling or slaughter of livestock. 3 9 CFR 313.15 describes the approved use of captive bolts 4 9 CFR 313.16 describes the approved use of gunshot 5 9 CFR 313.30 describes the approved use of electrical stunning 6 9 CFR 313.5 describes the approved use of carbon dioxide gas 7 9 CFR 313 does not allow other methods of humane slaughter; however, 9 CFR 303.1(h) authorizes FSIS to permit experimentation with new technologies. Compliance assistance with new technologies is available at New Technologies.', 'FSIS Compliance Guide for a Systematic Approach to the Humane Handling of Livestock Page 11 of 21 Step 2: Create a written plan FSIS believes that developing a written plan is the best second step toward a robust systematic approach to humane handling and slaughter because a written plan can effectively address the four aspects of a systematic approach. Without access to the written plan, FSIS will not be able to verify effective implementation of a program that the establishment believes reflects a robust systematic approach. Establishments address each item checked “False” in step one in a written plan. FSIS considers a written plan robust if it addresses each component of handling and slaughter at the establishment that could result in inhumane handling or inhumane slaughter of livestock. Establishments may consider the following elements important when developing a written plan (Attachment 3) for humane handling and slaughter: • A list of establishment humane handling and slaughter equipment and facilities identified as having the potential to result in inhumane handling or slaughter of livestock. (Attachment 2) • A list of procedures and monitoring frequencies sufficient to maintain humane handling and slaughter process control and prevent inhumane handling or slaughter. (Attachment 4) • A list of standards for maintaining facilities. (Attachment 2) • A list of corrective actions that address noncompliances and process control. • Provides for routine verification of implementation of the plan and reassessment and update of the plan. Step 3: Create a recordkeeping system FSIS believes that developing a recordkeeping system (Attachment 4) is the best third step toward a robust systematic approach to humane handling and slaughter. FSIS considers a recordkeeping system robust if it promotes accuracy and provides for accountability. Establishments may consider the following elements important features of a record keeping system: • Documents all monitoring, corrective action, verification, and reassessment activities. • Prevents unauthorized access, destruction, alteration, or removal of records. • Provides ready access and information sharing.', 'FSIS Compliance Guide for a Systematic Approach to the Humane Handling of Livestock Page 12 of 21 Attachment 1: HATS Categories and FSIS verification Activities Category FSIS Verification Regulations I.

Attachment 3: Sample EST 38 Humane Handling and Slaughter Plan Description of our business: We are a small, family-owned business producing specialty pork products. We typically slaughter one day per week. We raise all of the pigs we slaughter on our near-by family farm and transport them to the official establishment on the day of slaughter in a family-owned livestock trailer. We hold no live swine at the official establishment longer than 10-12 hours. The rear gate of the livestock trailer doubles as the off-loading ramp. We slaughter only healthy swine and sell all unhealthy swine to a local livestock dealer. Animal Handling Plan: Live pigs off-load from the livestock trailer directly into one of two open-air holding pens. The pens connect by a gate to a common covered alleyway that leads to the restrainer. All holding pen and alleyway floors are waffled and sloped to facilitate drainage. Holding pens have water troughs. Interior and exterior fence construction is comprised of commercial hog fence panels and gates fastened to metal posts set in concrete. We herd swine with polyethylene sorting panels purchased locally. The restrainer is a manual device. We use electrical stunning to produce cardiac arrest. We have a back-up hand-held captive bolt in case the electrical stunning equipment become inoperable. We purchased the restraining and stunning devices through a local supplier. We operate the electrical stunner and captive bolt according to the operator’s manuals that came with the equipment. Each stunned pig is shackled, hoisted, cut, and bled before we slaughter the next pig. Assessment/Reassessment: We based our initial assessment on the tool (attachment 2) in the FSIS Compliance Guide for a Systematic Approach to the Humane Handling of Livestock. We will reassess our plan as needed based on our monitoring results. We will document any reassessment, and summarize all changes to our plan and records, on the back of our monitoring record. Procedures, monitoring frequencies, and target values: We will list our procedures, monitoring frequencies, and objectives on the monitoring record. Documentation: We will record monitoring results on our monitoring record. We will create a record for each day we slaughter pigs. “Whenever the response to a monitoring question is “no” or at other times when a humane handling problem is identified, we will take immediate action to resolve it and document that action on the back of the monitoring record. Responses will follow these principles: 1.) If an animal is severely injured or in distress, we will immediately humanely euthanize; 2.) We will immediately halt or modify our operations when necessary to ensure all animals are handled humanely and not subject', 'FSIS Compliance Guide for a Systematic Approach to the Humane Handling of Livestock Page 19 of 21 to injury or distress; 3.) We will make any necessary repairs to facilities at the earliest possible opportunity. Within 30 days, one of the owners will review the monitoring record, verify any corrective actions, review any reassessment, and record the date verified on the monitoring record. We will maintain all completed monitoring records in the owner’s office for one year and then we will destroy them. We will make monitoring records available to FSIS in a timely manner.', 'FSIS Compliance Guide for a Systematic Approach to the Humane Handling of Livestock Page 20 of 21 Attachment 4: Sample EST 38 Humane Handling Monitoring Record EST 38 Humane Handling Monitoring Record for (enter date): Inspect livestock trailer first week of each month Circle Yes or No Free from protruding objects and sharp edges.
