text_by_page,"['A Generic HACCP Model for Fresh Ground Pork Sausage Patties The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) published the Pathogen Reduction/Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) Systems Final Rule in July 1996. The HACCP regulations (9 CFR Part 417) require establishments to develop and implement a system of controls designed to address safety hazards reasonably likely to occur in their production process. Therefore,this HACCP model’s focus, and the focus of the other HACCP models, is on product safety, not product quality characteristics. With the rule,FSISmade available aguidebook for the preparation of HACCPplans and ageneric model for each food processing category defined in the regulation (9 CFR 417.2(b)(1)). The guidebook and the generic models have been updated since their initial publication to be consistent with current science and policy. FSIS recommends you use of the updated Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans when developing an establishment-specific HACCP plan. Generic models serve as usefulexamples of how to meet the regulatory requirements. Each model represents a food processing category. Each processing category may contain numerous products. Therefore, each single model represents a category of products and, as such, the models do not demonstrate unique products or novel processes. The generic models are not intended to be used “as is”. FSIS recommends that establishments tailor the model(s) to fit the establishment’s operation. The model’s critical control points (CCPs) do not necessarily apply to all operations or products in the product category. Products or operations may require fewer or more CCPs depending on the operation. The flowdiagram demonstrates a general production process and should be modified to reflectthe processes used at theestablishment. The food safety critical limits selected must come from scientific documents or other reliable sourcesto meet regulatory validation requirements. Each modelincludes references for guidance on the selection of critical limits. To select the model that will be most useful for the products produced, consider the production activity occurring (slaughter, cutting, grinding, smoking, cooking, etc.), the product (beef, pork, chicken, etc.), and the food safety characteristics of the final product produced (intact or non-intact, raw or ready-to-eat, requires refrigeration or is shelf-stable, etc.). Examine the list of processing categories (9 CFR 417.2(b)(1)) and group similar products according to the categories. Many similar products may be grouped under the same category and HACCP plan. Selection of the processing categories reveal which of the generic models might be useful. Selecting the most appropriate model to work from will save the establishment time and personnel resources. Deciding on a generic model is an important achievement for your establishment. The records produced while documenting a HACCP plan, including all documentation used to support the hazard analysis are HACCP records (CFR 417.5(a)). The selection of processing categories and HACCP models are preliminary steps to completing a hazard analysis. The documents produced during the selection process are HACCP records. Ensure you maintain the documents produced while developing a HACCP plan. For further assistance with developing HACCP plans see the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans and the guidance materials available on the FSIS HACCP webpage.

This information is best suited for small and very small establishments seeking assistance in understanding the requirements in Title 9 Code of Federal Regulations(9 CFR)Part 417. The HACCP model is for demonstration purposes only. The model does not represent requirements that must be met. Establishments are required to develop HACCP plans specific to their facilities, production practices, and products. 2At risk populations include young children, elderly and immunocompromised persons.

Establishments’ hazard analyses for the same product may be different. Establishments determine which hazards are applicable to their process. 8 Hazards are grouped into threecategories:Biological(B), Chemical (C), and Physical(P). Biological hazardsarelivingorganisms. Chemical hazardsmaybe naturallyoccurringin foods, used, or added duringthe processingoffoods, or administered to live animals. Physical hazards areacomponent ofafood that is unexpected, such asplastic, glass, metal, or bone in a boneless product. See the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans for more information about hazards identification. 9Place thejustification for your decision in column 4. Include control measures in column 4 forhazards not reasonablylikely to occurandplace themin column 5forhazards reasonably likely to occur. Ifa hazard is reasonable likely to occur,then a CCP mustbe addressed at this step or a later step. See FSISMeat and Poultry Hazards and Controls Guide for a list of frequently used controls. 10Scientific references are important in making decisionsand providing justifications. When scientific references are used for decisions, the referenced article mustbe partof the HACCP records. If thescientific justificationis from FSIS,then list the document name. Ifjustificationis not from an FSISprogram, then scientific or technical support is needed, and thesenon-FSIS supporting documents must be keptfor the life ofthe HACCP plan. 11 Because the results obtained under prerequisite programs could affect decisions made in the hazard analysis, an establishment is required to maintain records associated with these programs as supporting documentation for its hazard analysis (9 CFR 417.5(a)). When an establishment determines that a potential hazard is not reasonably likely to occur because the implementation of a prerequisite program (e.g., Sanitation SOP,written sanitary dressing procedures incorporated into prerequisite programs, purchase specifications, antimicrobial interventions) prevents conditions that make the potential hazard likely, that prerequisite program then becomes part of the HACCP system and as a result, must be validated. This means thatestablishments must maintain scientific or technical support for the design of those prerequisite programs used to support decisions in the hazard analysis and must collect in-plant validation data to support that the programs are implemented as designed (see FSIS Compliance Guideline HACCP Systems Validation, page 5). 12 To determine the bestCCP to control, reduce, or eliminate a hazard, see FSIS Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans.
