text_by_page,"['Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures (Sanitation SOPs) are written procedures that an establishment develops and implements to prevent direct contamination or adulteration of product. The establishment is required to maintain these written procedures on file, and they must be available to FSIS upon request. The establishment is required to implement the procedures as written in the Sanitation SOPs. The establishment must maintain daily records sufficient to document the implementation and monitoring of the Sanitation SOPs and any corrective action taken. When the establishment or FSIS determines that the Sanitation SOPs may have failed to prevent direct contamination or adulteration of product, the establishment must implement corrective actions that include the appropriate disposition of product, restore sanitary conditions, and develop measures to prevent recurrence. These written Sanitation SOPs must contain the procedures the establishment will conduct before and during operation; the frequency with which each procedure is to be conducted; the establishment employee or position responsible and be signed and dated by the individual with overall authority. FSIS developed the Sanitation SOP modelforestablishmentstouse as a reference when developing Sanitation SOPs. The model was designed to assist establishments in applying the sanitation requirements to their operations and to meet the regulatory requirements of Part 416—Sanitation. The sanitation model is not intended to be used “as is” for industry Sanitation SOPs. Sanitation SOPs will varyfromone establishment to another because each facility will have its own processes that likely differ from that of another. An establishment must tailorthemodelto suit the specific circumstancesofits own products, productionprocesses and facilities. All elements of the model (e.g., frequencies, monitoring activities, corrective actions, and forms) must be modified (elements added or removed) to reflect the establishment’s products, production systems and facilities. This Sanitation SOP is for illustrative purposes only. Page 1of 16', 'A Sanitation Standard Operating Procedure Model This document provides an overview of the Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures (Sanitation SOPs)requirements, a Sanitation SOPmodel1(Attachment 1),and the complete text of the regulations cited in the document (Attachment 2). This information is to assist small and very small official establishments2 in understanding the requirements in Title 9 Code of Federal Regulations (9 CFR) Parts 416.11 – 416.17.3 The Sanitation SOPmodelisfor demonstration purposesonly. The modeldemonstratesa wayan establishment might develop Sanitation SOPs to meet the regulatory requirements of 9 CFR 416.11 – 416.17. The textand formattingused in the model do not represent requirements that must be met. The useof headings, numbered lists,and tables(forms) are not requirements that must be met. Establishments are required to develop Sanitation SOPs specific to their facilities, production practices,and products.4 Sanitation SOPs (9 CFR 416—Sanitation) Sanitation SOPs are written procedures that an establishment develops and implements to prevent direct contamination or adulteration of product (9 CFR 416.11 General Rules). The establishment is required to maintain these written procedures on file, and they must be available to Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) personnel upon request. The establishment is required to implement the procedures as written in their Sanitation SOPs. The establishment must maintain dailyrecords sufficient to document the implementation and monitoring of the Sanitation SOPs as well as any corrective action taken. When the establishment or FSIS determines that the Sanitation SOPs may have failed to prevent direct contamination or adulteration of product, the establishment must implement corrective actions that include the appropriate disposition of product, restore sanitary conditions, and develop measures to prevent recurrence. Development of Sanitation SOPs The establishment is required to develop written Sanitation SOPs that clearly describe procedures the establishment will implement to prevent direct contamination or adulteration of product. The Sanitation SOPs cover the entire establishment and all shifts of operation. These written procedures5must: • contain all the procedures the establishment will conduct daily, beforeand duringoperation, sufficient to prevent direct contamination or adulteration of product(s) (9 CFR 416.12(a)); 1The model presents Sanitation SOPsfor EstablishmentGrounds and Facilities (9 CFR 416.2),Equipment and Utensils (9 CFR 416.3), Sanitary operations (9 CFR 416.4) and Employee hygiene (9 CFR 416.5). 2 As stated in the HACCP rule,small establishments are defined as all establishments with 10 or more employees but fewer than 500 employees. Very small establishments are defined as all establishments with fewer than 10 employees or annual sales of less than $2.5 million. 3 The links to the CFR on pages 1, 2 and 3 take the user to Attachment 2. 4To ask questions or find posted Qs and As on these topics, see these external links: askFSIS Q&As and the Small Plant Help Desk. 5See public askFSIS Q&As on 9 CFR Part 416.12 requirements. Page 2of 16', '• identify the procedures to be conducted prior to operations (pre-operational) and address, at aminimum, the cleaning of food contact surfaces offacilities, equipment, and utensils (9 CFR 416.12(c)); • specify the frequency with which each procedure in the Sanitation SOP is to be conducted and identify the establishment employee or position responsible for the implementation and maintenance of the procedures (9 CFR 416.12(d)); and • be signed and dated by the individual with overall authority on-site or a higher-level official of the establishment. This signature signifies that the establishment will implement the Sanitation SOPs as written and will maintain the Sanitation SOPs in accordance with the requirements of this part of the regulation (9 CFR 416.12(b)). Implementation and Monitoring the Sanitation SOPs Establishments are required to develop written procedures that are sufficient to prevent direct contamination or adulteration of product. The establishment is also required to implement the procedures in its written Sanitation SOPs (9 CFR 416.13). The pre-operational procedures in the Sanitation SOPs are conducted before the start ofoperations(9 CFR 416.13(a)). All otherwritten procedures are conducted at the frequencies specified in the Sanitation SOPs (9 CFR 416.13(b)). In addition, establishments are required to monitor daily the implementation of the procedures in the Sanitation SOPs (9 CFR 416.13(c)). If the establishment writes a procedure in its Sanitation SOP, the regulations require that it implement that procedure at the stated frequency and monitor its implementation. Maintenance of the Sanitation SOPs Each establishment must meet two obligations to comply with the requirements for Sanitation SOP maintenance (9 CFR 416.14). First, the establishment is required to routinely evaluate the effectiveness of all Sanitation SOPs that have been implemented in their production operations. Second, the establishment is required to revise its Sanitation SOPs as needed to maintain effectiveness and to address any changes that have occurredincluding changes in facilities, equipment, utensils, operations, or personnel.6 Establishments are not required to record the methods used to evaluate their Sanitation SOPs and determine their effectiveness. If the establishment determines the Sanitation SOPs are no longer effective and current, they must be modified,signed,and dated. This regulatory requirement encourages establishments to develop a system for the evaluation of their written Sanitation SOPs to prevent direct contamination or adulteration of product. Establishments must identify the employeeswho areresponsible forthe implementation and maintenance of their Sanitation SOP procedures (9 CFR 416.12(d)). The establishment is required to identify the frequency with which each procedure isconducted by thoseemployees. The establishment must sign and date the Sanitation SOPs when firstcreated and any time modifications are made (9 CFR 416.12(b)). Thereareno regulatory requirements forestablishment personneltonotify FSIS of any change to their SOPs. 6 See askFSIS Q&As for information on maintenance of Sanitation SOPs. Page 3of 16', 'Corrective Actions The regulations require establishments to take corrective actions when either the establishment or FSIS determines that the Sanitation SOPs failed to prevent direct contamination or adulteration of product (9 CFR 416.15(b)). Regardless of the type or cause of the failure, corrective actions must be taken, including appropriate disposition of product.7 There are three parts to corrective action, and all three of these requirements must be met and recorded each time product contamination occurs (9 CFR 416.15). One common exception to recording corrective actions individually for each incident of product contamination is when the establishment has an effective product reconditioning program in the operational Sanitation SOP. With such a reconditioning program, they do not need to document each incident of direct contamination of productindividually. Inspection personnel will verify that the establishment implements these overarching procedureseffectively, including the use of,effective8 procedures to restore products to wholesome, unadulterated conditions. The establishment is not required to notify inspection personnel when product contamination occurs. The establishment is required to implement corrective actions that will meet the requirements (9 CFR 416.15(b)). Corrective action requirements under these regulations are: • Appropriate disposition of products that may be contaminated; • Restoration of sanitary conditions; and • Prevention of recurrence of direct contamination or adulteration of products. Re-evaluating and modifying the Sanitation SOPs and the specific procedures to which they refer is considered a corrective action. Improvements relating to the implementation of the Sanitation SOPs or the procedures to which they refer are also considered corrective actions. Recordkeeping The regulations require the establishment to maintain daily records (9 CFR 416.16(a)) sufficient to document the implementation and monitoring of the Sanitation SOPs as well as any corrective actions taken.9 To meet these requirements, the establishment must have records documenting that monitoring has been conducted daily for each of the procedures specified in the Sanitation SOPs. When Sanitation SOPmonitoring frequencies are more thanonce per day,the monitoring activities mustbe documented at the specified frequencies. The regulations require that the establishmentfollow the specified monitoring frequency established in the Sanitation SOP. The establishment employee specified in the Sanitation SOPs as being responsible for the implementation and monitoring of the procedures is required to authenticate these records with initials or signature and the date (9 CFR 416.16(a)). Records may be maintained on a computer system provided the establishment implements 7See askFSIS Q&As for information on Corrective Actions. 8Establishments must provide supporting information when a prerequisite program becomes part of the HACCP system. See page 16 of the FSIS Compliance Guideline HACCP Systems Validation guide for how to identify support for prerequisite programs. 9 See askFSIS Q&As for information on Recordkeeping. Page 4of 16', 'appropriate controls to ensure the integrity of the electronic data (9 CFR 416.16(b)). Records regarding the implementation of any corrective action mustbe kept on-site for a period of 48 hours once completed. After 48 hours, the records may be kept off-site but must be made readily available to FSISwithin 24 hours of original request. Sanitation SOP records must be maintained for at least6 months.10 (9 CFR 416.16(c)). 1Electronic records may be kept on an in-house computer or remote server for the first 48 hours. The electronic records must be readily available to FSIS during the 48 hour period.

Allsurfaces are rinsed with cold water. Equipmentissanitized with approved sanitizer and rinsed with potable water as appropriate. 5. Atthe end of the shift: major solids are physicallyremoved from floors, equipment, and food contact surfaces. Equipment is disassembled as required for adequate cleaning. Allsurfaces are rinsed with cold water. 6. Administrative personnel wear smocks and waterproof boots when in processing areas. Smocks are laundered in-house as needed. Maintenance workers wear gray uniforms and waterproof boots. Maintenance uniforms are laundered in-house as needed. 7. Prevention of cross-contamination: clothing and personal belongings are not stored in production areas. Workers do not eat food, chew gum, drink beverages, or use tobacco in production areas. Workers sanitize their boots in boot baths. Waste is removed from processing areas everyfourhours during production. Coolersare cleaned weeklyor more often if needed. Cooler evaporators are cleaned every six months or more often if needed. 8. Allergen control: allergen free productsareprocessed first, followed by products containing allergens. 9. Condensation:drip or condensate does not contaminate food or packaging materials. The finished product coolerismonitored twice a day. Condensation is removed in a sanitary manner. 10.Packaging materials are protected from contamination during storageand use. 11. Cleaning compounds, sanitizers and lubricants used in processing and packaging areas are food-grade. Non-food-grade chemicals and lubricants are stored separately outside processing and packaging areas. 12. Product reconditioning: an employee removes productfrom the floor in a timely manner, trimcontaminants from the productsurface area, wash the product at a product wash station, and examines it before returning it to production. This procedure is used for occasional instances of product contamination. 13. Employee health: employees are instructed to report to their supervisor any health condition that might result in food contamination. Monitoring and Recordkeeping The Team Captains are responsible for ensuring that employees’ hygiene practices, sanitary handling procedures, and cleaning procedures are maintained. The Team Captains monitor the sanitation procedures during the day. Results are recorded on the establishment’s Operational Sanitation Form daily. Page 8of 16', 'Corrective Action The Team Captains identify sanitation problems, stop production if necessary,and notify processing employees to take appropriate action to correct sanitation problems. If necessary, processing employees are retrained, and corrective actions are recorded on a Corrective Action Log. Establishment Grounds and Facilities Grounds and Pest Control Each day, after operations have ended, the Team Captain directs an employeeto examine: 1. The areaaround the building fortrash, debris,and garbage. All items found are disposed of in an appropriate waste container; 2. The areaaround the building for evidence of rodents,flies,and birds (nesting/feeding); 3. The rodent glue traps to ensure they are free of captured rodents and are properly placed and maintained; and, 4.
