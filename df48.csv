PURPOSE This is a guide for preparing drawings or blueprints, supplemental information, and room specifications which are to be submitted for approval as outlined in 0 CFR 592.140, Regulations Governing the inspection of Eggs and Egg Products. Plant drawings are for the purpose of establishing the area of the new official plant, plant layout, types of construction, floor drainage, location and types of equipment, air systems and description of other principal facilities at the location. There are specific facility and equipment requirements provided throughout the regulations and in applicable 3-A and E-3-A Sanitary Standards and Accepted Practices. II. SUBMITTAL OF PLANS The applicant is to submit drawings and supplemental information for approval to the Frontline Supervisor responsible for oversight of the new official egg products plant as part of the Application for Federal Inspection Service for egg products. The drawings are to consist of complete floor plans and a plot plan. Supplemental information and room specifications are to accompany the drawings. Upon receipt of the submitted drawings, the supervisor will make a preliminary review to determine their accuracy and completeness. Any necessary changes or corrections will be requested by the supervisor. The supervisor will return drawings to the applicant for corrections before a final review. A final review and approval of the submitted drawings will be determined by the Frontline Supervisor. A final survey of the finished facility will also be conducted by the supervisor or a designee followed by the communication of conformance with provisions of the approval and the regulations by the Frontline Supervisor. III. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS The drawings may be regular blueprints or ink drawings on durable-weight drawing paper. The sheet size of the print should not exceed 34 by 44 inches. The wording on each print is to be legible, all lines sharp and clear, and drawings properly drawn to scale. When blueprints are prepared, we recommend the plant keep the original drawings for future use. If revisions then become necessary at a later date, changes can be made on the original drawing and new copies prepared and submitted. This would eliminate the need for preparing complete new drawings and also reduce the use of overlays. Each individual prints is to show: (1) the scale used; (2) the north point of the compass; and (3) the firm name, street, city, State, and ZIP code, or an accurate description of the location.', 'DRAWING – BLUEPRINT GUIDE 2 IV. PLOT PLAN The plot plan of the entire premises is to include: A. The location of all buildings, roadways, alleys, drains, catch basins, wells, reservoirs, storage tanks, and any other major structure. B. Nearby buildings and types of businesses located on adjoining property. C. The drainage and slope of terrain. D. The character and surfacing of roadways, driveways, streets, and loading areas (including the loading area for a refuse room), and the paved tanker truck bays (with drainage) for shipping and receiving tankers. The plot plan may be drawn to scale of 1/32 inch per foot. V. FLOOR PLAN A. The floor plan drawings are to include the entire plant. a drawing is required for each floor of the plant and should accurately illustrate and describe the facilities. Each room is to be identified. Detailed prints for processing rooms should be drawn to a scale of 1/4 inch per foot. If a print includes only non-processing areas, it may be drawn to a scale of 1/8 inch per foot. Include the names of other firms, if any, occupying the building, their type of business, and the space occupied by them. If any rooms of the official plant will be used for purposes other than ones related to operation of the egg products plan, indicate this on the drawing and include a statement of explanation. B. Essential items to show on floor plans are the location of: 1. Walls, doors, hallways, stairways; 2. Intake and exhaust systems; 3. Hand washing facilities, floor drains, channel drains, toilet facilities, hose connections with hot and cold water for cleanup purposes; and 4. Storage tanks, conveyors, equipment racks, and other principal pieces of equipment. C. The prints should indicate the slope of floors to drains openings or channel drains by either grade lines or arrows. Floors which require drains shall slope more than 1/8 inch per foot to drains. Channel drains should have concave bottoms and must be self-draining. Channels should be at least 10 inches wide. They are to be provided with grates or covers designed for safety and efficient recovery of water. Prints for newly-constructed plants are to include the approximate location of all under floor or underground drainage lines. This may be added to the plot plan or floor plan of the entire plant.', 'DRAWING – BLUEPRINT GUIDE 3 D. Air systems for providing a positive flow of filtered air to breaking rooms, product packaging rooms (except for dried egg white packaging rooms), and blending rooms are to be shown with the following detail: 1. Pickup points of outside air; 2. Locations of fans; 3. Locations of air filters; and 4. Air distribution points in the room 5. Including pickup points for return air The air system is to be designed to supply filtered, outside air at a reasonable working temperatures. An adequate volume of air is needed to “pressurize” each processing room so that the air would move outward through any openings in the room. The filtered air should enter the room at a location which is opposite from the side where most of the air is expected to flow out of the room. Indicate the efficiency of the air filtration system. The location of all exhaust fans is to be shown. If the exhausts are ducted, the ducts are to be shown. E. Show the location of air compressors supplying air to breaking machines, packaging equipment, vacuum systems, and all pickup points of outside air. This requirement is related only to product contact air or air for product contact surfaces. New installations (air compressors, air filters, etc.) are to meet the standards set forth in E-3-A accepted practices. F. The following require detailed drawing of equipment and facilities. Special items to be shown are: 1. Transfer rooms a. Shell egg washers connected directly to drains or piped to drains so waste water does not flow over the floor. b.

Failure to comply with this requirement can be costly to a plant in terms of operating delays or corrections to unacceptable facility changes. Proposed changes and revisions may be submitted in draft form for review by: A. A completely revised sheet showing existing construction, equipment, and facilities with the proposed alterations and additions, or B. An overlay print drawn to the same scale as existing print covering the area to be modified or revised. IX. APPROVAL OF PRINTS AND PLANS If the examination of the drawings, supplemental information and room specification show that they meet regulatory requirements, approval will be given. The set of the approved prints will be maintained by the plant submitting the prints. Plant management is to make their file of approved blueprints readily available to the egg products inspector and the Frontline Supervisor when requested. A final review and approval of the submitted drawings will be determined by the Frontline Supervisor. A final survey of the finished facility will also be conducted by the supervisor or designee followed by the communication of conformance with provisions of the approval and the regulations by the Frontline Supervisor. Approved prints of a new plant requesting inspection service, or for changes in an existing plant, does not constitute operating approval. A final survey must be made by the Frontline Supervisor or', 'DRAWING – BLUEPRINT GUIDE 7 a designee to determine if the plant construction and facilities are in accordance with the approved prints and the regulations. On new and existing plants, a written communication to that effect will then be provided to the applicant by the Frontline Supervisor.', 'DRAWING – BLUEPRINT GUIDE 8 ROOM SPECIFICATION SHEET FOR BLUEPRINTS OF OFFICIAL EGG PRODUCTS PLANTS ROOM HEIGHT OF CEILING CEILING CONSTRUCTION FLOOR CONSTRUCTION WALL CONSTRUCTION Men’s toilet facilities: Number of lavatories________Urinals________ Stools_________ Maximum number of male employees per shift ________ Women’s toilet facilities: Number of Lavatories ___________ Stools ________________ Maximum number of female employees per shift __________']"
