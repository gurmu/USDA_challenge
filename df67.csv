FSIS test results show that the percent positive for Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) from trimmings produced from veal appears to be higher than that for trimmings produced from other cattle slaughter classes. FSIS identified common deficiencies: inadequate sanitary dressing, ineffective antimicrobial intervention implementation, and failure to use microbial data in decisionmaking. What are some examples of the sanitary dressing deficiencies FSIS observed repeatedly during onsite visits to veal slaughter establishments? Cutting through the weasand (esophagus) during sticking resulting in ingesta contaminating the carcass and head. Cutting through the hide and further processing without sanitizing knives, gloves, and equipment adequately to prevent carcass contamination.', '5 United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service sanitary dressing deficiencies Cutting through the hide and into the carcass without sanitizing knives, resulting in carcass contamination. Hide flaps contaminating carcass. Bagged bung contacting hide and contaminating carcass.', '6 United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service veal slaughter sanitary dressing deficiencies Exposed bung contaminating the carcass. Puncturing paunch and intestines during evisceration, resulting in carcass contamination. Ingesta from punctured paunch and intestines, resulting in carcass contamination.', '7 United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service sanitary dressing deficiencies Eviscerating carcass with the hide on, resulting in carcass contamination. Cold skinning (removing the hide after the carcass has chilled down), resulting in carcass contamination. Contaminated carcass in cooler as a result of sanitary dressing deficiencies.', '8 United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service veal slaughter sanitary dressing Contaminated packaged product in freezer as a result of sanitary dressing deficiencies. What are some examples of antimicrobial intervention implementation deficiencies FSIS observed repeatedly during onsite visits to veal slaughter establishments? Crosscontamination of heads from carcass intervention overspray.', '9 United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service antimicrobial intervention deficiencies Intervention failing to achieve full carcass coverage, thus reducing the intervention’s effectiveness. Intervention failing to achieve full product coverage, thus reducing the intervention’s effectiveness. Intervention failing to achieve full product coverage, thus reducing the intervention’s effectiveness.', 'veal slaughter sanitary dressing best practices 10 United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service veal slaughter sanitary dressing best practices What other issues did FSIS identify at veal slaughter establishments? FSIS observed that veal slaughter establishments were not properly evaluating testing results, including indicator organism results (e.g., generic E. coli, Aerobic Plant Count, or Enterobacteriaceae) on carcasses and STEC on beef manufacturing trimmings and in ground veal to help determine how the results impact their slaughter operation. What are some examples of best practices concerning sanitary dressing? Misting hides in pens to reduce dust and dirt particles. Rodding the weasand to free the weasand from the trachea, making it easier to close the weasand.', 'antimicrobial intervention deficiencies 11 United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service sanitary dressing best practices Weasand clip to prevent leakage of rumen contents. Reflecting the hide away from the carcass during skinning to prevent contamination from the hide. Dual knife system for sterilizing knives.', 'veal slaughter sanitary dressing best practices 12 United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service veal slaughter sanitary dressing best practices Hide clips for preventing contamination from the hide. Tying and bagging bung to prevent spillage of fecal material. Preventing puncturing the paunch and intestines during evisceration.', 'antimicrobial intervention deficiencies 13 United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service sanitary dressing best practices How do veal slaughter establishments implement effective sanitary dressing procedures to prevent carcass contamination and the creation of insanitary conditions? Establishments should develop a comprehensive written sanitary dressing program. The program should include written procedures to prevent carcass contamination. The program should include verification activities that ensure employees are performing the procedures as written and the procedures effectively prevent contamination. Establishments should assess the effectiveness of their procedures using real-time data and assess the impact of microbial results on their slaughter operation. What are some examples of best practices concerning antimicrobial intervention implementation? Hind limbs are spread apart to allow intervention to achieve full carcass coverage. Applying intervention according to supporting documentation. All nozzles are operational, and critical operating parameters are met. Lactic acid dispenser with gauges for monitoring temperature and pressure that, depending on the establishment’s supporting documentation, may be critical operating parameters.', '14 United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service veal slaughter sanitary dressing best practices How do veal slaughter establishments implement antimicrobial interventions effectively? • Identify supporting documentation that closely matches selected intervention. • Identify critical operating parameters in the supporting documentation. Critical operating parameters are the specific conditions (such as contact time, pH, temperature, and concentration) of the intervention that must be met for the intervention to be effective. • Incorporate critical operating parameters into Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system. • Implement intervention so that it meets critical operating parameters. How do establishments properly assess microbial testing results? • Use test results to assess the effectiveness of their controls for preventing contamination. • Identify specific criteria for use when the slaughter process is determined to be out of control. • Verify that their slaughter controls are reducing STEC to a non-detectable level on an ongoing basis. • Review sanitary dressing procedures and intervention measures to investigate the cause when microbial test results indicate a loss of process control. • Perform increased microbial testing to demonstrate that the corrective actions taken in response to the loss of process control are effective. FSIS developed the Compliance Guideline for Establishments Sampling Beef Trimmings for Shiga Toxin-Producing Escherichia coli (STEC) Organisms or Virulence Markers. This guidance has general information on verification testing, designing sampling plans, and factors affecting the design of sampling.', '15 United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service antimicrobial intervention best practices Where do establishments find more information about sanitary dressing and process-control procedures?
