text_by_page,"['HACCP Model for Beef Slaughter The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) published the Pathogen Reduction/Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) Systems Final Rule in July 1996 mandating all USDA inspected meat and poultry establishments implement a HACCP system. Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) is a systematic and scientific method of process control for the production of safe food products. The HACCP regulations (9 CFR Part 417) require establishments to develop and implement a system of controls designed to improve the safety of their products. The HACCP models’ focus is on product safety, not product quality characteristics. With the rule, FSIS made available a guidebook for the preparation of HACCP plans and a generic model for each food processing category defined in the regulation (9 CFR 417.2(b)(1)). The guidebook and the generic models have been revised since their initial publication to be consistent with current science and policy. FSIS recommends you use the updated Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans when developing an establishment-specific HACCP plan. Generic models serve as useful examples of how to meet the regulatory requirements. Each model represents a food processing category. Each processing category may contain numerous products. Therefore, each single model represents a category of products and, as such, the models do not demonstrate unique products or novel processes. The generic models are not intended to be used “as is”. Establishments are to tailor the model(s) to fit the establishment’s operation. This generic HACCP model illustrates the slaughter processing category. Although this is a beef slaughter model, the model may be used as a starting point for developing a slaughter HACCP plan for other classes of livestock. The slaughter process has inherent food safety hazards that originate with the live animal. Therefore, the slaughter process has heightened food safety significance. Slaughter establishments typically produce carcasses which are raw intact finished products. The food safety hazards identified for the slaughter process are also common to the Raw Intact and Raw Non-Intact processing categories. The model’s critical control points (CCPs) do not necessarily apply to all slaughter operations or products. Products or operations may require fewer or more CCPs depending on the operation. The flow diagram demonstrates a general production process and should be modified to reflect the processes used at the establishment. The food safety critical limits selected must come from scientific documents or other reliable sources. This model includes references for guidance on the selection of critical limits. The records produced while documenting a HACCP plan, including all documentation used to support the hazard analysis are HACCP records (CFR 417.5(a)). Ensure you maintain the documents produced while developing a HACCP plan. For further assistance with developing HACCP plans see the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans and the guidance materials available on the FSIS HACCP webpage.', 'Page 2 of 16 EXAMPLE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION1 Process / Product Name: Beef Slaughter Process / Product Name Carcass and carcass parts, tongue, heart, liver, kidney and intestine.

The FSIS Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans and the generic HACCP models are intended for small and very small establishments seeking assistance in understanding the requirements in Title 9 Code of Federal Regulations (9 CFR) Part 417. The HACCP models are for demonstration purposes only. The models do not represent requirements that must be met. Establishments are required to develop HACCP plans specific to their facilities, production practices, and products. 2 The intended use or consumer of the product must be identified in accordance with 9 CFR 417.2(a)(2). Identifying the product’s intended use in the product description is one way to meet the regulatory requirements specific to 417.2(a)(2). 3 At-risk populations include young children, the elderly and immunocompromised persons.', 'Page 3 of 16 EXAMPLE LIST OF PRODUCT INGREDIENTS AND INCOMING MATERIALS Process / Product Name: Beef Slaughter Meat and meat by-products4 Beef Non-Meat food ingredients None Antimicrobials5 or processing aids Organic Acid6 Packaging material Product bags and cardboard boxes Restricted ingredients or allergens None Other None DATE: APPROVED BY: 4 List all meat (beef), processing aids, and packaging material used in production of these products. This is important to help identify any special ingredients or processes to address in the HACCP plan. 5 FSIS and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that establishes the working relationship followed when responding to notifications for the use of food additives (including ingredients) intended for use in the production of FSIS regulated products. FSIS determines the suitability of the use of food ingredients used in the production of meat, poultry, and egg products. FSIS consults, as necessary, with FDA on the requirements under the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations. See FSIS Directive 7120.1, Safe and Suitable Ingredients Used in Meat, Poultry and Egg Products for the list of suitable ingredients. 6 There are many different organic acids (for example, lactic acid, acetic acid). If used, establishments will need to select a product best suited for their unique circumstances.', 'Page 4 of 16 7 This is an example flow diagram. Establishments’ flow diagrams for the same product may be different. Establishments determine which steps are included in their process. The steps must represent all relevant hazards in the hazard analysis. The Meat and Poultry Hazards and Controls Guide (starting on page 5) describes the usual process steps, potential hazards and frequently used controls for beef slaughter. 8 The Returned Product step (16) is shown as not connected to another process step. Returned product may re-enter the production system at different process steps depending on condition or problem. Returned product may be relabeled, re-processed, discarded, etc. 9 In this model, beef heart undergoes the same CCPs as carcasses because the heart meat may be a component of ground beef.

P: Foreign Material No Lack of historical findings from visual inspection during livestock handling and slaughter.15 10 This is an example hazard analysis. Each establishment’s flow chart, hazards analysis, hazards, decision-making, and support may be different. An establishment can determine what “steps” are included in the overall process if all of the hazards are considered in the hazard analysis. The FSIS Meat and Poultry Hazards and Controls Guide (starting on page 5) describes the usual process steps for beef slaughter. 11 Hazards are grouped into three categories: Biological (B), Chemical (C), and Physical (P). Biological hazards are living organisms. Chemical hazards may be naturally occurring in foods, used or added during the processing of foods, or administered to live animals. Physical hazards are a component of a food that is unexpected, such as plastic, glass, metal, or bone in a boneless product. See the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans for more information about hazards identification. 12 Place the justification for your decision in column 4. Control measures either go in column 4 for hazards not reasonably likely to occur or go in column 5 for hazards reasonably likely to occur. If a hazard is reasonably likely to occur, then a CCP must be addressed at the step where the hazard is recognized or a later step. See FSIS Meat and Poultry Hazards and Controls Guide for a list of frequently used controls. 13 Scientific references are important in making decisions, providing justifications, and validating the HACCP system. When scientific references are used for decisions, the referenced article must be part of the HACCP records. If the scientific justification is from FSIS, then list the document name. If justification is not from an FSIS document, then HACCP system design must be supported by documentary evidence – that is, the theoretical principles, expert advice from processing authorities, scientific or technical data, peerreviewed journal articles, pathogen modeling programs, or other information demonstrating that particular process control measures can adequately prevent, reduce, or eliminate specific hazards. These non-FSIS supporting documents must be kept for the life of the HACCP plan. 14 Because the results obtained under prerequisite programs could affect decisions made in the hazard analysis, an establishment is required to maintain records associated with these programs as supporting documentation for its hazard analysis (9 CFR 417.5(a)). When an establishment determines that a potential hazard is not reasonably likely to occur (NRLTO) because the implementation of a prerequisite program (e.g., Sanitation Standard Operating Procedure (Sanitation SOP), written sanitary dressing procedures incorporated into prerequisite programs, purchase specifications, antimicrobial interventions) prevents conditions that make the potential hazard likely, that prerequisite program then becomes part of the HACCP system and as a result, must be validated. This means that establishments must maintain scientific or technical support for the design of those prerequisite programs used to support decisions in the hazard analysis and must collect in-plant validation data to support that the programs are implemented as designed (see FSIS Compliance Guideline HACCP Systems Validation). 15 Note: this “historical data” must be supported with evidence from the establishment through the establishment’s history or validation data with reference to the actual SOP or prerequisite program. When historical data is not available (for example, a HACCP plan for a new process or product), then system design must be supported by other documentary evidence, such as the FSIS Meat and Poultry Hazards and Controls Guide which states “visual examination of carcass, parts and viscera” is a frequently used control for foreign material hazards in beef slaughter.', 'Step Potential Hazard RLTO Justification / Basis Controls CCP Page 6 of 16 (needles, wire, buckshot, bullets).

Hearts are not subject to the FSIS zero-tolerance standard. Hearts are included in this step because they can become a component of raw ground beef products. Therefore, hearts undergo the same CCPs as the carcass.18 CCP 1 Zero Tolerance Examination for carcasses and hearts. If contamination occurs, it is removed by trimming (9 CFR 310.18(a)).

In this model, hearts are subject to the CCP 1 Zero Tolerance Examination, although beef hearts are not subject to FSIS’ zero tolerance policy.

CCP 3 19 If an establishment implements a process consistent with the process specifications described in the scientific support, and the scientific support contains microbiological data specifying the level of pathogen reduction achieved by the intervention strategy for the target pathogen identified in the hazard analysis, the in-plant validation data collected during the 90 day initial validation period will consist of data on quantifiable characteristics of the critical operational parameters, such as pressure, temperature, and concentration (FSIS Compliance Guideline HACCP Systems Validation, page 27). 20 The Pennsylvania State University worked with Texas Tech University and Washington State University to generate new data that very small establishments can use to effectively remove pathogens from carcass surfaces. See the Antimicrobial Spray Treatments for Red Meat Carcasses Processed in Very Small Meat Establishments for additional information. 21 FSIS Directive 7120.1, Safe and Suitable Ingredients Used in Meat, Poultry and Egg Products contains the list of substances that may be used in the production of meat and poultry products. The list contains the allowable amounts and the intended use of the approved antimicrobials. The list (Directive 7120.1) can be used as supporting documentation for chemical hazard controls (safety and suitability). Directive 7120.1 cannot be used as support for the control of biological hazards because the antimicrobial concentration needed to control bacteria is different from the concentrations required for safety and suitability.', 'Step Potential Hazard RLTO Justification / Basis Controls CCP Page 12 of 16 C: None P: None 13.
