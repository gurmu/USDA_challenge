Some of these small producers are going further by building processing facilities with the intent of supplying local customers, including household consumers, retail stores, restaurants, boarding houses, and institutions. Other producers and businesses are building processing plants to supply poultry that meets special religious dietary requirements such as Kosher and Halaal or (Halal), and niche markets, such as organically grown poultry and live poultry markets. At some point, a grower or business that plans to or has made the decision to sell poultry that he or she slaughters or processes will face the question “Can I sell the poultry that I slaughter or process, without inspection by the Federal or State government?” The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) of the Department of Agriculture (USDA) created this guide to help small businesses and poultry producers who slaughter or process poultry for human food to determine whether the slaughter or processing operations at their businesses are eligible for exemption from Federal or State inspection. In other words, this guide is helpful to producers or businesses in determining whether their slaughter or processing operations require USDA or State inspection, as mandated in the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA). In addition, this guidance material can serve as a quick reference for Federal and State inspection personnel who have questions about whether a poultry operation qualifies for a exemption in the PPIA. This guidance does not address exemptions related to livestock product (e.g., meat from cattle, swine, sheep, goat, and equine) because the Federal Meat Inspection Act does not provide exemptions similar to those provided in the Poultry Products Inspection Act. In addition, this guidance material does not address exemptions requirements where State Laws may be different from those in the PPIA and FSIS/USDA regulations. The 1957 Wholesome Poultry Products Act (Public Law 90 – 492), which is commonly referred to as the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA)1 was passed by Congress to ensure that only wholesome poultry that is not 1 A copy of the Poultry Product Inspection Act can be accessed by browsing the FSIS home page at (http://www.fsis.usda.gov/regulations_&_policies/Poultry_Products_Inspection_Act/index.asp). This is the Act found in the United States Codes Sections 451-470. There are published copies of the PPIA with the sections numbered from 1to 29 that correspond to U.S. Code sections 451 to 470. 1', 'adulterated and not misbranded enters interstate or foreign commerce. The 1957 Act mandated Federal inspection at businesses that slaughter poultry or process poultry products that enter interstate or foreign commerce. Congress amended the Act in 1968, extending the mandate for Federal inspection to all businesses that slaughter or process poultry for shipment within a State, when the State does not enforce requirements at least equal to the Federal inspection requirements in the PPIA. Because of this amendment, any business in any State that slaughters or processes poultry for use as human food is required to do so under Federal or State inspection, unless the slaughter or processing operations at the business meets certain exemption criteria in the Act. What does exempt mean? The term “exempt” means that certain types of poultry slaughter and processing operations qualify to operate without the benefit of Federal inspection on a daily basis, and a grant of Federal inspection is not required. Such operations are exempt from continuous bird-by-bird inspection and the presence of inspectors during the slaughter of poultry and processing of poultry products. However, a facility operating under such an exemption is not exempt from all requirements of the Act. It was not the intent of Congress to mandate Federal or State inspection of an owner’s private holdings of poultry or to mandate inspection at businesses that slaughter or process a small amount of poultry. Therefore, the PPIA exempts some poultry slaughter and some processing operations from certain requirements of the Act. The Act does not exempt any person slaughtering or processing poultry from the provisions requiring the manufacturing of poultry products that are not adulterated and not misbranded. Thus, all businesses slaughtering or processing poultry for use as human food, including exempt operations, must produce poultry product that is not adulterated or misbranded. How is Adulteration Defined? Both the PPIA and the supporting Federal regulations define the circumstances and conditions that would render poultry products adulterated. Simply put, a product is adulterated if it bears or contains a substance that makes it injurious to health, or if it has been held, packed or produced under insanitary conditions. The specific definitions of circumstances that define adulteration are detailed in Section 453 of the PPIA, and in Title 9 Code of Federal Regulations ( 9 CFR). In addition, the definitions have been reproduced as Attachment 5 of this document. To qualify for any one of the poultry exemptions, a business must slaughter poultry or process poultry products under sanitary conditions using procedures that produce sound, clean poultry products fit for human food. Attachment 2 of this guidance is a list of sanitary standards and procedures. These sanitation procedures and practices are required for poultry businesses receiving full USDA inspection and are applicable to exempt poultry operations [Title 9 CFR part 416]. 2', 'Specific sanitary practices are described in FSIS’s Sanitation Performance Standards Compliance Guide, dated October 13, 1999. The specific sanitary practices in the document are not requirements. In the Guide, FSIS presents or references methods already proven effective in maintaining sanitary conditions in meat and poultry establishments. Establishments that follow the guidance can be fairly certain that they comply with the requirements in the Act and regulations to conduct operations under sanitary standards, practices, and procedures that result in poultry products that are not adulterated. How is Misbranded Defined? The regulations require that poultry products transported or distributed in commerce bear specific information. Poultry products inspected and passed under USDA inspection at official USDA establishments must bear the official inspection legend and meet specific labeling requirements prescribed in the regulation. However, exempt poultry products cannot bear the official mark of inspection. In addition, there is specific labeling or identification requirements for exempt product to meet in lieu of bearing all required elements of a label. The information that shipping containers or packages of exempt poultry products must bear varies depending on the exemption. The specific information required on the shipping containers or packages of exempt products is presented later in discussions for each type of exemption. What is Commerce? Commerce is the exchange or transportation of poultry products between States, U.S. territories (Guam, Virgin Island of the United States, and American Samoa), and the District of Columbia [Title 9 CFR §381.1(b)]. In this document, we qualify “commerce” with “interstate” when referencing the exchange or transportation of poultry products between States, United States territories, and the District of Columbia. We also qualify “commerce” with “intrastate” when referring to the exchange or transportation of poultry products solely within a State, territory, or the District of Columbia. FSIS will not view the product as having been introduced into commerce if it has not left the control of the processing entity. What is Slaughter? The term slaughter refers to the act of killing poultry for use as human food. What is Processed or Processing? The terms “processed” and “processing” refer to operations in which the carcasses of slaughtered poultry are defeathered, eviscerated, cut-up, skinned, boned, canned, salted, stuffed, rendered, or otherwise manufactured or processed. 3', 'How can I determine whether an operation qualifies for an exemption under the Poultry Products Inspection Act? Use the decision chart on the following page to determine whether a slaughter or processing operation qualifies for one of the exemptions in the PPIA and supporting regulations. Read the question in bold type in the squares and then follow the “yes” or “no” response arrows to determine the exemption, if any, under which the poultry products may be produced. When the arrows lead to an oval read the exemption criteria for the exemption on the page indicated in the oval to determine the exemption, if any, for which the slaughter or processing operation would qualify. You should contact the FSIS District Office responsible for Federal inspection or the State Agency responsible for administering a State Poultry Inspection Program in the State where your slaughter and processing is located. This contact will facilitate reviews of the operation by FSIS or the State Agency with oversight of businesses operating under an exemption in your State. Some States may have requirements in their exemption laws for a business to qualify for an exemption that differ from Federal requirements. The FSIS District Office or the State Agency will determine whether your operation qualifies for the exemption. Attachments 3 and 4 are lists of FSIS district offices for the Office of Field Operations (OFO), and FSIS regional offices of the Office of Program Evaluation Enforcement and Review (OPEER), and State contacts. The information in these lists is subject to change as is the web/ulr cite for, OFO and OPEER. If you slaughter or process poultry that is donated or sold for use as human food, and the operation does not qualify for an exemption from inspection, you must contact the FSIS District Office or State Office responsible for inspection in the State where your operation is located. The FSIS District Office or State Office will provide instructions and guidance on obtaining FSIS or State inspection for your poultry products. Because the poultry exemption categories are complicated, please contact a FSIS, District Office if you have any questions. 4', '5 Do you slaughter or process poultry Is the poultry you slaughter or process for your private use?

Contact the e 4 and Attachment 3 Decision Flow Chart for Poultry Exemptions Under the PPIA* Producer/ Grower – 20,000 Limit Exemption', 'Exemptions Personal Use Exemption Mandatory inspection of the slaughter and processing of privately owned poultry is not required, provided that the following six criteria are met [PPIA Section 464(c)(1)(A), (d), & (e) “Section 15 (2)(1)(A),(d) & (e)”2; Title 9 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) §381.10(a)(3)]. Criteria: 1. The slaughtered and processed poultry is for the private use of the: a. grower/producer/owner, b. members of his or her household, and c. his or her nonpaying guests and employees; 2. The slaughter and processing of the poultry is performed by the grower/producer/owner; 3. The poultry is healthy when slaughtered; 4. The poultry is slaughtered and processed under sanitary conditions and practices that result in poultry products that are sound and fit for human food; 5. The exempt poultry is not sold or donated for use as human food; and 6. The shipping containers bear: a. the producer’s name, b. the producer’s address, and c. the statement, Exempt P.L. 90-492. “Exempt P.L. 90-492"" identifies the product as product produced under an exemption from the Act, Public Law 90-492. Instead of the Federal law 90-492, a State law may be cited when the inspection of the slaughter and processing of poultry is exempted under the authority of a State law and the operations are reviewed by a State Agency. Personal Use Exemption Notes: • There is no limit to the total amount of poultry that owners of poultry may slaughter and process for their private use. • If any of the six criteria are not met, the poultry is not eligible to be processed under the Personal Use Exemption. 2 Some published copies of the PPIA number the sections from 1 to 29 not 451 to 470 as numbered in the United States Codes. 6', 'Custom Slaughter/Processing Exemption A custom poultry slaughterer is a business or person who slaughters and processes poultry belonging to someone else. A custom slaughterer provides a service to a customer and does not engage in the business of buying or selling poultry products capable of use as human food. A custom slaughter business may slaughter or process an unlimited number of poultry when the poultry is delivered by the owner and the following five criteria are met [PPIA Section 464(c)(1)(B) “Section 15 (c)(1)(B)”3; Title 9 CFR §381.10(a)(4) & (d)]. Criteria: 1. The custom slaughterer does not engage in the business of buying or selling poultry products capable for use as human food; 2. The poultry is healthy when slaughtered; 3. The slaughter and processing at the custom slaughter facility is conducted in accordance with sanitary standards, practices, and procedures that produce poultry products that are sound, clean, and fit for human food (not adulterated); 4. The custom slaughtered or processed poultry is for the personal use of the grower/owner of the poultry – the grower/owner of the custom slaughtered or processed poultry may not sell or donate the custom slaughtered poultry to another person or institution; and 5. The shipping containers bear: a. the owner’s name, b. the owner’s address, and c. the statement, “Exempt P.L. 90-492” These three items are in lieu of all the required features of a label for inspected and passed poultry products. Also, instead of the Federal law 90-492, a State law may be cited when the inspection of the slaughter and processing of poultry is exempted under the authority of a State law, and the operations are reviewed by a State Agency. Custom Slaughter Exemption Notes: • If any of the five criteria are not met, the owner of the poultry is not eligible for this exemption. 3 Some published copies of the PPIA number the sections 1 to 29 not 451 to 470 as numbered in the United States Codes. 7', '• Selling live poultry to a customer does not disqualify a business from the Custom Slaughter Exemption. For example, a custom slaughterer may sell live poultry to a person and then custom slaughter the bird. However, a person who custom slaughters poultry may not buy or sell poultry products used for human food. • A person operating under a Custom Slaughter Exemption may slaughter and process poultry of his or her own raising provided such slaughtered poultry is for his or her exclusive consumption, or consumption by members of his or her household, nonpaying guests, and employees. • A person who is a custom slaughterer and who is also a poultry grower may raise and sell his or her live poultry to poultry businesses not associated with his or her custom slaughter business. • A custom slaughter business may use a mobile slaughter/ processing unit to custom slaughter and process poultry. There is compliance with the requirements of the Act and regulations when the owner of poultry delivers poultry to a mobile slaughter/processing unit operated by a custom slaughterer provided the slaughtered or processed poultry is for the personal use of the owner of the poultry. The owner of the poultry may deliver the poultry to the mobile slaughter/processing unit located at his or her own premises or any other person’s premises. • Ostrich and other poultry can be custom slaughtered and processed in an official red meat establishment that is subject to the regulatory requirements of the Federal Meat Inspection Act, provided the establishment does not engage in the business of buying and selling poultry products. Also, carcasses or parts of ostrich or poultry not slaughtered at the red meat establishment may be delivered by the owner for custom processing provided the poultry has been previously inspected, passed, and identified as such in accordance with the requirements of the Poultry Products Inspection Act or has been inspected and passed by an equivalent State inspection. 8', 'Producer/Grower – 1,000 Limit Exemption Limited provisions of the Act apply to poultry growers who slaughter no more than 1,000 poultry in a calendar year for use as human food. A person may slaughter and process on his or her premises poultry that he or she raised and they may distribute such poultry without mandatory inspection when the following five criteria are met [PPIA Section 464(c)(4) “Section 15 (c)(4)”4; Title 9 CFR §381.10(c)]. Criteria: 1. The poultry grower slaughters no more that 1,000 healthy birds of his or her own raising in a calendar year for distribution as human food; 2. The poultry grower does not engage in buying or selling poultry products other than those produced from poultry raised on his or her own farm; 3. The slaughter and processing are conducted under sanitary standards, practices, and procedures that produce poultry products that are sound, clean, and fit for human food (not adulterated); 4. The producer keeps records necessary for the effective enforcement of the Act [Title 9 CFR 381.175]; and 5. The poultry products do not move in commerce. Note: Commerce means the exchange or transportation of poultry products between States, U.S. territories (Guam, Virgin Island of the United States, and American Samoa), and the District of Columbia [PPIA Section 453; Title 9CFR §381.1(b)]. Producer/Grower – 1,000 Limit Exemption Notes: • If any of the five criteria are not met, the owner of the poultry is not eligible for this exemption. • Records necessary for the effective enforcement of the Act include slaughter records and records covering the sales of poultry products to customers. USDA/FSIS or State employees review such records to determine compliance with the requirement of the sale of no more than 1,000 poultry in a calendar year. 4 Some published copies of the PPIA number the sections 1to 29 not 451 to 470 as numbered in the United States Codes. 9', ""Producer/Grower – 20,000 Limit Exemption A poultry grower may slaughter and process more than 1,000 birds as exempt product for distribution as human food when the following eight criteria are met [PPIA Section 464(c)(1)(C) &(c)(3) “Section 15 (c)(4)”5; Title 9 CFR §381.10(a)(5) and (b)(1) and (2)]. Criteria: 1. The producer/grower slaughters and processes, on his or her own premises, no more than 20,000 poultry, raised by him or her, in a calendar year; 2. The producer/grower sells, in a calendar year, only poultry or poultry products he or she prepares according to the criteria for the Producer/Grower – 20,000 Limit Exemption; he or she may not buy or sell poultry products prepared under another exemption in the same calendar year in which he or she claims the Producer/Grower – 20,000 Limit Exemption [PPIA Section (464)(c)(1) last sentence before (c)(2)]; 3.

The facility used to slaughter or process the poultry is not used to slaughter or process another person’s poultry unless the Administrator of FSIS grants an exemption [PPIA Section 464(c)(3); Title 9 CFR 381.10b)(2)] 8. The shipping containers, when distributed in intrastate commerce (instead of the required features of a label of inspected product) bear: a. producer’s name, b. producer's address, and 5 Some published copies of the PPIA number the sections 1to 29 not 451 to 470 as numbered in the United States Codes. 10"", 'c. the statement, “Exempt P.L. 90-492.” Instead of the Federal law, a State law may be cited when operations are exempted under the authority of a State law and the operations are reviewed by a State Agency. Producer/Grower 20,000 Limit Exemption Notes: • The producer/grower may sell, intrastate, the poultry products he or she prepares to other businesses for resale as meat or meals, including a distributor, hotel, restaurant, retail store, institution, or small enterprise when the product is produced under a Federal or a State exemption. • FSIS has determined that when a grower producing poultry under the Producer/Grower Exemption rents slaughtering or processing equipment and operates such equipment on his or her premises, he or she is not disqualified for the Producer/Grower Exemption. In this situation, the grower is not required to request an exemption from the Administrator of FSIS. However, the slaughter or processing unit may not be used to slaughter or process another person’s poultry while it is on the renter’s premises. Producer/Grower or Other Person (PGOP) Exemption The term “Producer/Grower or Other Person” (PGOP) refers to a single entity, which may be: (1) A poultry grower who slaughters and processes poultry that he or she raised for sale directly to household consumers, restaurants, hotels, and boarding houses to be used in those homes and dining rooms for the preparation of meals served or sold directly to customers. (2) A person who purchases live poultry from a grower and then slaughters these poultry and processes such poultry for sale directly to household consumers, restaurants, hotels, and boarding houses to be served in those homes or dining rooms for the preparation of meals sold directly to customers.

Retail Exemption (Store/Dealer/Restaurant): A retail business is a facility where poultry products are sold to a customer (household consumers and hotels, restaurants, and similar institutions) at the retail business and the amount purchased by the customer is considered to be a normal amount for a retail purchase. The Act provides for several types of retail exemptions: (1) the Retail Dealer Exemption, (2) the Retail Store Exemption, and (3) the Restaurant Exemption. The type of poultry slaughter and processing operations a business conducts determines which retail exemption under which the business may produce poultry. A business is qualified to operate under a retail exemption when the following criteria are met [PPIA Section 454.(c)(2) “Section 5 (c)(2)”8”, PPIA Section 464.(a)(1) “Section 15 (c)(2)”7;.Title 9 CFR 381.10(a)(1) and (d)(2)(vi), and 381.10(d)(1) and (d)(2)(i), (ii) and (iii)]. 8 Some published copies of the PPIA number the sections form 1to 29 not 451-470 as numbered in the United States Codes. 15', 'Criteria: 1.

No canning operation is conducted in the retail store; Note: Poultry products produced under a Retail Store Exemption are not misbranded when they bear all of the features of an official label with the exception that the labeling does not indicate that the product was inspected and passes. Official label requirements include the following: 1. Name of the product, 2. Ingredients statement, 3. Statement of the quantity of contents in terms of weight or measures, 4. Name and address of manufacturer, 5. Handling statement, 6. Safe handling instruction that comply with the requirements of 9 CFR 381.125(b)(2)(ii), 7. Date of packing, and 8. Explanatory statement indicating why the inspection legend is not permitted; for example, the phrase “Retail Exemption from Inspection” is suggested by FSIS but is not a mandatory requirement. In addition, if the labeling does not bear nutrition or health claims, the nutrition facts feature, as explained in, Title 9 CFR 381.500 , is optional for poultry products produced by a business eligible for the small enterprise exemption. 11. Product sold in commerce is not misbranded; Title Exemption from nutritional labeling 12. Sales of poultry and poultry products are in normal retail quantities or served to consumers at the retail store (normal retail quantities are 75 pounds or less to household consumers and 150 pounds or less to hotels, restaurants, and similar institutions); and 13. Sales to hotels, restaurants, and similar institutions do not exceed either one of two limits: 1. 25 percent of the dollar value of total poultry product sales, or 2. the calendar year dollar limit for retail stores set by the Administrator of FSIS; 17', 'Note: retail store dollar limitation is the limit, measured in dollars, on sales of poultry products by retail stores each calendar year to non-household consumers such as hotels, restaurants, and similar institutions. stores may not exceed a specific dollar limit on the sale of poultry products to hotels, restaurants, and similar institutions. dollar limitation is adjusted during the first quarter of the year if the Consumer Price Index, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, indicates an increase or decrease of more than $500 in the price of the same volume of product from the previous year. FSIS publishes a notice of the adjusted dollar limitation in the through products that are derived from USDA inspected and passed poultry that are not further processed at the retail store. The To maintain their exemption from inspection under the PPIA, retail The Federal Register. The dollar limitation amount on retail sales does not include pass- Retail Store Exemption Notes: When a retail store that slaughters poultry takes orders for dressed poultry before the arrival of the customer, and also slaughters several birds at one time for various customers that have requested them, the birds must be identified throughout the process so that processed bird that the customer receives is the same live birds selected for or by the customer. How many exemptions may a person or business claim when slaughtering or processing poultry? A person or business may slaughter or process poultry under an exemption if the operation qualifies for the exemption. However, a slaughterer or processor of poultry may not simultaneously operate under more than one exemption. When FSIS or a State reviews a business to determine compliance with the Act and regulations, FSIS or the State inspectors must be informed of which exemption the business is claiming. FSIS or State inspectors will determine compliance based on only one exemption. A business may not simultaneously claim or operate under more than one exemption. 18', 'The selection of either the Producer/Grower Exemption or the Producer/Grower or Other Person Exemption is for the calendar year. In the same calendar year, a poultry producer or other person producing product under either the Producer/Grower Exemption or the Producer/Grower or Other Person Exemption may not produce product under another exemption. In addition, a poultry business that slaughters or processes poultry operating under a Custom Slaughter or Small Enterprise Exemption may not operate under the Producer/Grower or Producer/Grower or Other Person exemption in the same calendar year. A facility or business may house more than one exempt operation if there is complete financial and structural autonomy of each operation. A true and complete separation must exist between the business records and the physical structures (rooms and equipment) of the two operations. A facility or business producing product under a Custom Slaughter, Small Enterprise, or Retail Store Exemption may operate under another one of these three exemptions in the same calendar when there is financial and temporal autonomy of each operation. For example, a person using a facility for a custom slaughter business may close the custom slaughter business and open a retail store or small enterprise business at the facility in the same calendar year. Who determines whether an operation qualifies for an exemption? Inspectors of the USDA/FSIS are authorized to make inspections in accordance with the law to ascertain whether any of the provisions of the Act or the regulations applying to producers, retailers, or other persons purporting to be exempt form and requirements (criteria) of the Act have been violated. [Code of Federal Regulations Title 9 Section 381.14 ] A State that does not operate a poultry inspection program at least equal to the Federal poultry inspection program is a “Designated State” [Title 9 Code of Federal Regulations Subpart V §381.220-225]. In a designated State, FSIS is responsible for conducting reviews of establishments operating under exemptions provided for in Section 15 of the PPIA i.e. personnel use, retail dealer, custom slaughter, poultry producers, or small enterprise exemptions and of retail stores operating under the PPIA, Section 5(c)(2) retail exemption. Such reviews may be conducted by a State Agency under a cooperative agreement with FSIS/USDA. When either a State Agency that has a cooperative agreement with FSIS or FSIS determines that an exempt operation does not comply with requirements of the Act, USDA is responsible for enforcement of compliance with the requirements of the Act. In States that operate a poultry inspection program equivalent to the Federal inspection program, a State Agency conducts inspections and reviews of exempted operations. Suspension or termination of exemptions 19', 'The Administrator of FSIS may, by order, in accordance with the applicable rules of practice [Code of Federal Regulations Title 9 Part 500] suspend or terminate any exemption with respect to any person whenever FSIS finds that such action will aid in effectuating the purposes of the Act. Failure to comply with the conditions (criteria) of the exemption including but not limited to failure to process poultry and poultry products under clean and sanitary condition may result in termination of an exemption, in addition to other penalties [Code of Federal Regulations Title ( Section 318.13]. Religious dietary exemption To avoid conflicts with certain religious dietary requirements, the PPIA allows for exemption from certain requirements of the PPIA and the regulations when a religious dietary requirement conflicts with the Act or regulations. However, this exemption from certain requirements of the PPIA and the regulations is granted only if the purposes of the Act or regulations are met. Unlike the exemption previously discussed in this guidance, only official establishments may receive an exemption from a specific regulation that conflicts with a religious dietary requirement. An official establishment may request a religious dietary exemption on FSIS Form 5200-1 at the time that the establishment applies for inspection. Poultry prepared in accordance with a religious dietary law under a religious exemption does not bear the official inspection legend but must meet all inspection and regulatory requirements not specifically listed on the submitted application (FSIS Form 5200-1) and exempted on the exemption certificate issued by FSIS. 20', 'Attachment 1.

The list is a summary of the regulatory requirements for sanitation procedures and practices that are required for a poultry business receiving full U.S. Department of Agriculture inspection and are applicable to poultry exempt operations {Title 9 CFR Part 416}. In addition, specific sanitary practices are described in FSIS’s Sanitation Performance Standards Compliance Guide, dated October 13, 1999. This 92-page document is also available from http://www.fsis.usda.gov/FSIS_Employees/Compliance_Guides_Index/index.asp A. Sanitary operating conditions. All food-contact surfaces and non-food-contact surfaces of an exempt facility are cleaned and sanitized as frequently as necessary to prevent the creation of insanitary conditions and the adulteration of product. Cleaning compounds, sanitizing agents, processing aids, and other chemicals used by an exempt facility are safe and effective under the conditions of use. Such chemicals are used, handled, and stored in a manner that will not adulterate product or create insanitary conditions. Documentation substantiating the safety of a chemical's use in a food processing environment are available to inspection program employees for review. Product is protected from adulteration during processing, handling, storage, loading, and unloading and during transportation from official establishments. B. Grounds and pest control. The grounds of exempt operation are maintained to prevent conditions that could lead to insanitary conditions or adulteration of product. Plant operators have in place a pest management program to prevent the harborage and breeding of pests on the grounds and within the facilities. The operator's pest control operation is capable of preventing product adulteration. Management makes every effort to prevent entry of rodents, insects, or animals into areas where products are handled, processed, or stored. Openings (doors and windows) leading to the outside or to areas holding inedible product have effective closures and completely fill the openings. Areas inside and outside the facility are maintained to prevent harborage of rodents and insects. The pest control substances used are safe and effective under the conditions of use and are not applied or stored in a manner that will result in the adulteration of product or the creation of insanitary conditions. C. Sewage and waste disposal. Sewage and waste disposal systems properly remove sewage and waste materials—feces, feathers, trash, garbage, and paper—from the facility. Sewage is disposed of into a sewage system separate from all other drainage lines or disposed of through other means sufficient to prevent backup of sewage into areas where product is processed, handled, or stored. When the sewage disposal system is a private system requiring approval by a State or local health authority, upon request, the management must furnish to the inspector a letter of approval from that authority. 23"", 'D. Water supply and water, ice, and solution reuse. A supply of running water that complies with the National Primary Drinking Water regulations (40 CFR part 141) at a suitable temperature and under pressure as needed, is provided in all areas where required (for processing product; for cleaning rooms and equipment, utensils, and packaging materials; for employee sanitary facilities, etc.). If a facility uses a municipal water supply, it must make available to the inspector, upon request, a water report, issued under the authority of the State or local health agency, certifying or attesting to the potability of the water supply. If a facility uses a private well for its water supply, it must make available to the inspector, upon request, documentation certifying the potability of the water supply that has been renewed at least semi-annually. E. Facilities. Maintenance of facilities during slaughtering and processing is accomplished in a manner to ensure the production of wholesome, unadulterated product. F. Dressing rooms, lavatories, and toilets. Dressing rooms, toilet rooms, and urinals are sufficient in number ample in size, conveniently located, and maintained in a sanitary condition and in good repair at all times to ensure cleanliness of all persons handling any product. Dressing rooms, lavatories, and toilets are separate from the rooms and compartments in which products are processed, stored, or handled. G. Inedible Material Control. The operator handles and maintains inedible material in a manner that prevents the diversion of inedible animal products into human food channels and prevents the adulteration of human food. 24', 'Attachment 3 FSIS District Office Contact Information http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Contact_Us/Office_Locations_&_Ph one_Numbers/index.asp District Office Location Office Address & Telephone Number States and Territories Covered by District Alameda, CA 620 Central Avenue Building 2C Alameda, CA 94501 Phone: (510) 337-5000 FAX: (510) 337-5081 California Albany, NY 230 Washington Ave. Extension Albany, NY 12203-5369 Phone: (518) 452-6870 Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont Atlanta, GA 100 Alabama St., SW; Bldg 1924 Suite 3R90 Atlanta, GA 30303 Phone: (404) 562-5900 Florida, Georgia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.
