The following are recommended: * Establish a procedure to assure that ice is collected and held in a container that drains freely and in a sanitary manner. The procedure should address collection and washing of ice before it is reused. * Establish a procedure for identifying reused ice from fresh ice. * The ice or the product should be packaged in an impervious, sealed container, such as a plastic bag, to prevent direct contact between the product and ice. * Ice used on raw product should not be reused on any partially- or fully-cooked product. * The ice should be free of any observable foreign material as well as large particles of poultry meat and fat. If the ice is washed, continuous drainage should be maintained during the washing procedure. * Ice from damaged containers should not be used. * Establish procedures to correct deficiencies that occur and to prevent reoccurrence.', '2 BRINE REUSE Brine may be reused to chill cooked product for various lengths of time based on the type of casing, salinity, and temperature. Brine solution that is reused to chill raw or heat-treated, but not fully cooked product ( e.g., smoked bacon) should be reconditioned in a manner to prevent the brine solution from becoming contaminated and adulterating the product. Brine reuse to chill raw product should follow the same criteria as brine reused to chill heat-treated, not fully cooked product. The following are recommended: * Establish procedures for monitoring the temperature, salinity, and free chlorine concentration of the brine being reused to chill heat-treated product. * Establish an ongoing microbiological plan to ensure that the brine solution is maintained pathogen free. The monitoring plan should cover the type and frequency of any microbiological analysis, action limits (upper/lower control limits), and actions taken to ensure product safety when those limits are exceeded. It is recommended that the establishment perform the following ongoing monitoring of the reused brine solution: Cooked Product Analysis Frequency Action Level Total Plate Count Daily >2500 cfu/ml Total Coliform Weekly Positive Fecal Coliform Weekly Positive Raw or Heat-Treated, Not Fully Cooked Product (i.e. Bacon Bellies) Analysis Frequency Action Level Total Plate Count Daily >5000 cfu/ml Total Coliform Weekly >10 cfu/ml Fecal Coliform Weekly Positive * Initially, frequency of microbial testing should be at the highest level until control is established. Reduced testing may be appropriate once control has been established.', '3 However, loss of control may necessitate a return to increased testing frequency until system controls are reestablished. * Visible contamination defects should be removed from the product before it is placed in the brine solution. * The solution should be kept free of visible meat and fat particles and other objectionable conditions by effective methods such as filtration, skimming, or overflow. * When the brine solution is used without reconditioning for one shift or longer, the solution should be discarded at the following specified intervals, and all equipment, tanks, lines should be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized: Heat-Treated Product Duration of Use (Classes) Additional Conditions One production All Classes: None shift No casing Perforated casing Edible casing Semipermeable casing Impermeable casing Up to 24 hours All classes: 1. Minimum salt 5% No casing (19° salimeter) Perforated casing 2. Maintain 40° F. Edible casing or lower Semipermeable casing Impermeable casing Up to 1 week One class: 1. Minimum salt 9% Semipermeable casing (32° salimeter) Impermeable casing 2. Maintain 28° F. or lower Up to 4 weeks One class: 1. Minimum salt 20% Semipermeable casing (76° salimeter) Impermeable casing 2. Maintain 10° F. or lower', '4 * Cooked product, for example frankfurters, cannot be chilled in a brine solution that has been used to chill raw or heattreated, not fully cooked product, for example, bacon bellies. (Raw product may be chilled after cooked product). * Products with semipermeable or impermeable casing that are being chilled in brine that is being reused for longer than 24 hours should be trimmed if they have broken casings or have been similarly exposed. The trimmings should be discarded as inedible. * A free chlorine concentration of 1-5 ppm should be maintained in the reuse brine solution. * Establish procedures to correct deficiencies that occur and to prevent reoccurrence.', '5 COOK AND CHILL WATER REUSE Water may be reused to cook product and to chill cooked product. The following are recommended: * Establish procedures for monitoring the temperature of the cook or chill water, and free chlorine concentration of the chill water being reused to chill cooked product. * Establish an ongoing microbiological plan to ensure that the reuse cook or chill water is maintained pathogen free. The monitoring plan should cover the type and frequency of any microbiological analysis, action limits (upper/lower control limits), and actions taken to ensure product safety when those limits are exceeded. It is recommended that the establishment perform the following ongoing monitoring of the reused cook and/or chill water: Chill Water Analysis Frequency Action Level Total Plate Count Daily >500 cfu/ml Total Coliform Weekly Positive Fecal Coliform Weekly Positive Turbidity Weekly >5 NTU Cook Water Analysis Frequency Action Level Total Plate Count Daily >500 cfu/ml Gas Forming Anaerobes Weekly >10 cfu/ml Total Coliform Weekly Positive Turbidity Weekly >5 NTU * Initially, frequency of microbial testing would be at the highest level until control is established. Reduced testing may be appropriate once control has been established.

It is recommended that product be enclosed within an impervious package. * Products that are exposed to the propylene glycol solution should be appropriately handled as contaminated product. One appropriate way of handling the contaminated product would be to rewash the product by water spraying. All traces of refrigerant should be removed before product is passed for food. If water washing or trimming cannot remove all contamination, the affected portion should be condemned. * The propylene glycol solution should be adequately removed from the packaged products after freezing and before placing into shipping containers by effective methods such as water spray washing equipment. * A free chlorine concentration of 1-5 ppm is recommended to be maintained in the propylene glycol. * Establish procedures to correct deficiencies that occur and to prevent reoccurrence.', '9 CHILLER OVERFLOW WATER REUSE Overflow water from the poultry chilling units may be reused to move heavy solids in eviscerating troughs (not to flush sides of trough), scald tank, picker aprons, and washing picking room floors.
