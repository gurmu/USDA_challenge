The HACCP regulations (9 CFR Part 417) require establishments to develop and implement a system of controls designed to address safety hazards reasonably likely to occur in their production process. Therefore, this HACCP model’s focus, and the focus of the other HACCP models, is on product safety, not product quality characteristics. With the rule, FSIS made available a guidebook for the preparation of HACCP plans and a generic model for each food processing category defined in regulation 9 CFR 417.2(b)(1). The guidebook and the generic models have been updated since their initial publication to be consistent with current science and policy. FSIS recommends you use the updated Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans when developing an establishment-specific HACCP plan. Generic models serve as useful examples of how to meet the regulatory requirements. Each model represents a food processing category. Each processing category may contain numerous products. Therefore, each single model represents a category of products and, as such, the models do not demonstrate unique products or novel processes. The generic models are not intended to be used “as is”. FSIS recommends that establishments tailor the model(s) to fit the establishment’s operation. The model’s critical control points (CCPs) do not necessarily apply to all operations or products in the product category. Products or operations may require fewer or more CCPs depending on the operation. The flow diagram demonstrates a general production process and should be modified to reflect the processes used at the establishment. The food safety critical limits selected must come from scientific documents or other reliable sources to meet regulatory validation requirements. Each model includes references for guidance on the selection of critical limits. FSIS published two poultry slaughter HACCP models. This model can be used with the Streamlined Inspection System (SIS), New Evisceration Line Speed (NELS), New Turkey Inspection System (NTIS) and Traditional poultry slaughter inspection systems. The other published model can be used with the New Poultry Inspection System (NPIS). The defining difference between this model and the NPIS model is the additional NPIS responsibility of sorting and disposing of carcasses and viscera exhibiting septicemic and toxemic conditions. Many Small and Very Small poultry slaughter establishments operate under Traditional Inspection and this is the model best suited for those operations. The records produced while documenting a HACCP plan, including all documentation used to support the hazard analysis, are HACCP records ((CFR 417.5(a)). The selection of a poultry slaughter HACCP model is a preliminary step to completing a hazard analysis. The documents produced during the selection process are HACCP records. Ensure you maintain the documents produced while developing a HACCP plan. For further assistance with developing HACCP plans see the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans and the guidance materials available on the FSIS HACCP webpage.', 'Page 2 of 19 EXAMPLE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION1 Process / Product Name: Poultry Slaughter2 Whole Carcasses, Parts, Other Intact Poultry Products Process / product type name Young Ready-to-Cook chicken, other types of whole dressed poultry carcasses (turkeys, ducks, geese), single ingredient intact poultry products, such as parts, giblets, paws, and turkey fries Important product characteristics (Aw, pH, preservatives, etc.) Not Applicable How it is to be used For further processing at this facility or another establishment or Intended for cooking by end consumer Packaging (durability and storage conditions) Vacuum packaged, tray packs, giblets in plastic sealed containers, bulk pack boxes with liners.

FSIS determines the suitability of the use of food ingredients used in the production of meat, poultry, and egg products. FSIS consults, as necessary, with FDA on the requirements under the Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations.

Biological hazards are living organisms. Chemical hazards may be naturally occurring in foods, used, or added during the processing of foods, or administered to live animals. Physical hazards are a component in a food product that is unexpected, such as plastic, glass, metal, or bone in a boneless product. See the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans for more information about hazards identification. 11 Place the justification for your decision in column 4. Include control measures in column 4 for hazards not reasonably likely to occur and place them in column 5 for hazards reasonably likely to occur. If a hazard is reasonable likely to occur, then a CCP must be addressed at this step or a later step. See FSIS Meat and Poultry Hazards and Controls Guide for a list of frequently used controls. 12 Scientific references are important in making decisions, providing justifications, and validating the HACCP system. When scientific references are used for decisions, the referenced article must be part of the HACCP records. If the scientific justification is from FSIS, then list the document name. If justification is not from an FSIS program, then HACCP system design must be supported by documentary evidence – that is, the theoretical principles, expert advice from processing authorities, scientific or technical data, peerreviewed journal articles, pathogen modeling programs, or other information demonstrating that particular process control measures can adequately prevent, reduce, or eliminate specific hazards. These non-FSIS supporting documents must be kept for the life of the HACCP plan. 13 Because the results obtained under prerequisite programs could affect decisions made in the hazard analysis, an establishment is required to maintain records associated with these programs as supporting documentation for its hazard analysis (9 CFR 417.5(a)). When an establishment determines that a potential hazard is not reasonably likely to occur because the implementation of a prerequisite program (e.g., Sanitation SOP, written sanitary dressing procedures incorporated into prerequisite programs, purchase specifications, antimicrobial interventions) prevents conditions that make the potential hazard likely, that prerequisite program then becomes part of the HACCP system and as a result, must be validated. This means that establishments must maintain scientific or technical support for the design of those prerequisite programs used to support decisions in the hazard analysis and must collect in-plant validation data to support that the programs are implemented as designed (see FSIS Compliance Guideline HACCP Systems Validation, page 5). 14 To develop an effective CCP, see the FSIS Guidebook for the Development of HACCP Plans for a CCP decision tree and guidance on how to control, reduce, or eliminate a hazard.

If justification is not from an FSIS program, then scientific or technical support is needed, and these nonFSIS supporting documents must be kept for the life of the HACCP plan 16 NOTE: This “historic data” must be supported with evidence from the establishment through the establishment’s history or validation data with reference to the SOP or prerequisite program. When historical data is not available (for example, a HACCP plan for a new process or product), then system design must be supported by other documentary evidence. Such as the FSIS Meat and Poultry Hazards and Controls Guide which states “Monitor giblets for foreign materials” and “Metal detection” as frequently used controls for foreign material hazards in poultry slaughter. 17 This Foreign Material SOP (prerequisite program) should have details on how this procedure is preventing the hazard from occurring (such as metal prevention controls) as well as the on-going verification procedures. These controls should be evident within the written document upon review. The Foreign Material SOP and plant data related to on-going verification activities then become part of recordkeeping and historic data. 1.

FSIS Directive 7120.1, Safe and Suitable Ingredients Used in Meat, Poultry and Egg Products contains the list of substances that may be used in the production of meat and poultry products. The list contains the allowable amounts and the intended use of the approved antimicrobials. The list (Directive 7120.1) can be used as supporting documentation for chemical hazard controls (safety and suitability). Directive 7120.1 cannot be used as support for the control of biological hazards because the antimicrobial concentration needed to control bacteria is different from the concentrations required for safety and suitability. 1a.
