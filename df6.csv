Clarification--Packing Dates on Poultry Labeling Recently, an issue regarding the appropriate application of the Federal poultry products inspection regulations on ""date of packing"" (9 CFR 381.126) arose. The circumstances involved a processor who packages poultry food products in consumer-ready film-wrapped packages that are in refrigerated storage awaiting shipment to customers when orders are received. At the time an order is received, a price label and sell-by date is applied to the consumer packages that are then placed in master shippers to which box end labeling, including a ""pack date,"" is applied. The pack date that has been applied, however, has been the date the consumer packages are placed in the shipper, not the original pack date on which the poultry was slaughtered and placed in the consumer packaging. The application of the date the consumer packages are placed in the shipper does not constitute the ""pack date"" that is required by Federal regulations. The regulations indicate that the pack date can be applied to the shipper or immediate containers of poultry food products using either a code or the actual calendar date of packing. The date of packing is the original date the poultry is slaughtered and placed in the consumer packaging; the use of any other calendar date will mislead consumers. After discussions with the company and the National Chicken Council, it was resolved that, perhaps, misinterpretation of the pack date provisions has occurred within industry. Understanding that the immediate containers or the shipping containers of poultry food products must be marked with the original pack date, there are actually three options available to poultry processors to comply with the packing date provisions, one of which must be used. These options are: a code is applied that represents the original pack date of the poultry food product in the consumer package, or the original pack date of the poultry food product is applied to the consumer package or the shipping container', 'accompanied by an explanatory statement, e.g., ""packing date"" (per 9 CFR 381.129 (c) (2)), or the original pack date of the poultry food product is applied to the consumer package or the shipping container along with a date representing when the consumer packages are placed in shippers. In this case, each date must be accompanied by an explanatory statement in accordance with 9 CFR 381.129 (c) (2), e.g., ""packing date,"" and ""date put in shipping container.""
