Document Summary This document is intended as a supplemental guide to the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) data requirements when an Automated Broker Interface (ABI) filer (broker or self-filing importer) is using the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) System of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to provide PGA Message Set data. Specifically this guidance covers the data to be provided when a filer is submitting an Entry Summary certified for Cargo Release for products regulated by FSIS. The CBP Customs and Trade Automated Interface Requirements (CATAIR) chapters and appendices can be found on CBP.gov at: http://www.cbp.gov/document/guidance/pga-message-set The PGA Message Set and its related Appendix PGA can be found on CBP.gov at: http://search.usa.gov/search?query=pga+message+set&affiliate=cbpgov Other related appendices that could be used when submitting an entry can be found at: http://search.usa.gov/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&affiliate=cbpgov&query=appendix+b It should be noted that the PGA Message Set does not stand alone and must be submitted with an entry filing (i.e. ACE Entry Summary certified for cargo release (AE)). The Entry Summary contains certain data elements that are common to both FSIS and CBP requirements. The PGA Message Set data requirements for FSIS will not duplicate those common data elements, but rather provide the additional data needed to complete the FSIS application for import inspection (FSIS Form 9540-1) electronically. This guidance provides data samples of frequently imported products. The samples include a grid and accompanying text. The grid represents the 80- character limit, per record, allowed by ABI. The PGA Message Set defines the character length, class and position required by ABI for transmission to CBP and the grid shows how the data would be represented in ABI. 1', ""FSIS Overview FSIS is the public health regulatory agency responsible for ensuring that domestic and imported meat, poultry, and processed egg products are safe, wholesome, and correctly labeled and packaged. Through the 2008 and 2014 Farm Bills, FSIS now inspects Siluriformes, including catfish, under the Federal Meat Inspection Act. FSIS ensures that meat, poultry, egg products, and Siluriformes imported to the United States originate from eligible countries and are produced under standards equivalent to U.S. inspection standards. In order to enhance the Agency's ability to protect public health, FSIS has launched the Public Health Information System (PHIS) as part of its effort to collect, consolidate, and analyze data. The PHIS interface with ACE enables seamless transfer of data required for the application for FSIS import inspection in advance of the shipment arrival. The inclusion of the data in the PGA Message Set eliminates the need to submit a paper copy of FSIS Form 9540-1 eliminates the manual data entry by FSIS inspection personnel and thereby, expedites the clearance of FSIS regulated shipments. All shipments of meat, poultry, egg products, and Siluriformes (including catfish) imported to the United States must be presented to FSIS at an official import inspection establishment for reinspection prior to release into commerce in the United States. Eligibility of the foreign country, foreign establishment, and product will be determined by the PHIS when the Importer of Record or U.S. Customs Broker files the mandatory application for FSIS import inspection. FSIS ensures that the exporting country’s inspection certificates are authentic and accurate, and when assigned by the PHIS, FSIS performs a more in-depth reinspection of product, including product examination and laboratory testing for pathogens and chemical residues. FSIS sampling is allocated by country, process category, product category, product group, and species and the inspection results are entered into the PHIS. If the shipment fails reinspection, the noncompliant product is refused entry and the rate of inspection is intensified to ensure product compliance of subsequent shipments. FSIS PGA Message Set – FSIS Electronic Application (FSIS Form 9540-1) Data Requirements Below is the set of data elements FSIS requires from the trade, depending on the commodity and depending on whether electronic certification (government-to-government eCert) is applicable.

Some of the data elements needed to complete the ABI entry is supplied from the foreign inspection certificate, which accompanies each shipment. It is important to note that currently, FSIS receives official certification electronically from Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands. For filers making entries from these three countries, the filer only needs to identify the inspection certificate number in PG14. 3', 'The PGA Message Set requirement for records identifying specific lot information will automatically populate from the data received from the foreign country’s electronic certification into PHIS.
