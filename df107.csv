text_by_page,"['HACCP Model for Traditional Swine Slaughter The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) published the Pathogen Reduction/Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) Systems Final Rule in July 1996 mandating all USDA inspected meat and poultry establishments implement a HACCP system. Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) is asystematicand scientific method of process control for the production of safe food products. The HACCP regulations (9 CFR Part 417) require establishments to develop and implement a system of controls designed to improve the safety of their products. The HACCP models’ focus is on product safety, not product quality characteristics. With the rule, FSIS made available aguidebook for the preparation of HACCP plans and ageneric model for each food processing category defined in the regulation (9 CFR 417.2(b)(1)). The guidebook and the generic models have been revised since their initial publication to be consistent with current science and policy. FSIS recommends you use of the updated Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans when developing an establishment-specific HACCP plan. Generic models serve as useful examples of how to meet the regulatory requirements. Each model represents a food processing category. Each processing category may contain numerous products. Therefore, each single model represents a category of products and, as such, the models do not demonstrate unique products or novel processes. The generic models are not intended to be used “as is”. Establishments are to tailor the model(s) to fit the establishment’s operation. The model’s critical control points (CCPs) do not necessarily apply to all operations or products. Products or operations may require fewer or more CCPs depending on the operation. The flow diagram demonstrates a general production process and should be modified to reflect the processes used at the establishment. The food safety critical limits selectedmust come from scientific documents or other reliable sources. Each model includes references for guidance on the selection of critical limits. To select the model that will be most useful for the products produced, consider the production activity occurring (slaughter, cutting, grinding, smoking, cooking, etc.), the product (beef, pork, chicken, etc.), and the food safety characteristics of the final product produced (intact or non-intact, raw or ready-to-eat, requires refrigeration or is shelf-stable, etc.). Examine the list of processing categories (9 CFR 417.2(b)(1)) and group similar products according to the categories. It is common for many products to be grouped under the same category and HACCP plan. Selection of the processing categories reveals which of the generic models might be useful. Selecting the most appropriate model to work from will save the establishment time and personnel resources. Deciding on a generic model is an important achievement for your establishment. The records produced while documenting a HACCP plan, including all documentation used to support the hazard analysis are HACCP records (CFR 417.5(a)). The selection of processing categories and HACCP models are preliminary steps to completing a hazard analysis. The documents produced during the selection process are HACCP records. Ensure you maintain the documents produced while developing a HACCP plan. For further assistance with developing HACCP plans see the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans and the guidance materials available on the FSIS HACCP webpage.

Biological hazardsarelivingorganisms. Chemical hazardsmaybe naturallyoccurringin foods, used, or added duringtheprocessingoffoods, or administered to live animals. Physical hazards areacomponent ofafood that is unexpected, such asplastic, glass, metal, or bone in a boneless product. See the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans for more information about hazards identification. 11Place thejustification for your decision in column 4. Include control measures in column 4 forhazards not reasonably likely to occurand place them in column 5 forhazards reasonably likely to occur. Ifa hazard is reasonable likely to occur,then a CCP must beaddressed at this step or a later step. See FSISMeat and Poultry Hazards and Controls Guide for a list of frequently used controls. 12Scientificreferences are important in making decisions, providing justifications, and validating the HACCPsystem. When scientific references are used for decisions, the referencedarticle must be part ofthe HACCP records. If the scientificjustification isfromFSIS, then list the document name. If justificationis not from an FSISprogram, then HACCP system design must be supported by documentary evidence –that is,documents depictingthe theoretical principles, expert advice from processing authorities, scientific or technical data, peer-reviewed journal articles, pathogen modeling programs, or other information demonstrating that particular process control measures can adequately prevent, reduce, or eliminate specific hazards. These non-FSIS supporting documents must be kept for the life of the HACCP plan. 13Because the results obtained under prerequisite programs could affect decisions made in the hazard analysis, an establishmentis required to maintain records associated with theseprograms as supporting documentation for its hazard analysis (9 CFR 417.5(a)). When an establishment determines that a potential hazard is not reasonablylikely to occur because the implementation of a prerequisite program (e.g., Sanitation SOP,written sanitary dressing procedures incorporatedinto prerequisite programs, purchase specifications, antimicrobial interventions) prevents conditions that make the potential hazard likely, that prerequisite program then becomes part of the HACCP system and as a result, must be validated. This means that establishments must maintain scientific or technical support for the design of those prerequisite programs used to support decisions in the hazard analysis and must collect in-plant validation data to support that the programs are implemented as designed (see FSIS Compliance Guideline HACCPSystems Validation, page 5). 14To determine whether a CCP is necessary, see Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCPPlans for decision tree to evaluate the areas of control (column 5) to determine the best CCP to control, reduce, or eliminate a hazard.

The list (Directive 7120.1) can be usedas supporting documentationfor chemical hazard controls(safety and suitability). Directive 7120.1 cannot be usedas supportforthe control ofbiological hazards because the antimicrobialconcentrationneeded to controlbacteria is different from the concentrationsrequired for safety and suitability. 26 If an establishment implements aprocess consistent with the process specifications described in the scientific support, and the scientific support containsmicrobiological data specifying the level of pathogen reduction achieved by the intervention strategy for the target pathogen identified in the hazard analysis, the in-plant validation data collected during the 90 day initial validation period will consist of data on quantifiable characteristics of the critical operational parameters, such as pressure, temperature, and concentration. However,if an establishment implements different critical operational parameters in the process from the scientificsupport,or the scientificsupport identified does not contain microbiologicaldata, then the establishment should collect in-plant data demonstrating the criticaloperational parameters that ithas implemented can all be met AND should collect in-plant microbiologicalvalidation data or identify scientific support with microbiological data that demonstrates the effectiveness of those implemented critical operational parameter (FSIS Compliance Guideline HACCPSystems Validation, page 27).
