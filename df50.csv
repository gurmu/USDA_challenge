Establishments do not generically approve labels. FSIS approves labels through generic labeling regulations. 5', '\uf0d8By regulation, FSIS specified when a generic approval could be undertaken by an establishment (9 CFR 317.5 and 381.133) \uf0d8Generic approval forgoes the need to obtain sketch approval \uf0d8Prior to the new rule •specific labels were eligible for generic approval AND •certain changes could be made generically to sketch approved labels 6', '\uf0d8On November 7, 2013, FSIS published a final rule that amended the meat and poultry products inspection regulations to expand the circumstances under which the labels of meat and poultry products would be deemed to be generically approved by the Agency \uf0d8Effective January 2014, four categories of labels now REQUIRE sketch approval \uf0d8ALL OTHER labels that do not fit into one of the four categories do not require sketch approval by LPDS 7', '\uf0d8Final rule amended FSIS regulations to combine the previous regulations that provided for labeling approval (9 CFR 317.4 and 381.132) and generically approved labeling (9 CFR 317.5 and 381.133) for meat and poultry products into one new section \uf0d8New label approval regulations for meat and poultry products now in 9 CFR 412.1; approval of generic labels now in 9 CFR 412.2 8', '\uf0d8 Only certain types of labeling require submission for evaluation by LPDS • labels for temporary approval (9 CFR 412.1(c)(4)) • labels for products produced under religious exemption (9 CFR 412.1(c)(1)) • labels for products for export with labeling deviations (9 CFR 412.1(c)(2)) • labels with special statements and claims (9 CFR 412.1(c)(3)) \uf0d8 FSIS will continue to require the submission of such labels because they are more likely to present significant policy issues that have health or economic significance 9', 'New Generic Labeling Final Rule introduces the four categories of labels that require prior approval by LPDS: ◦Temporary labels ◦Religious exemption ◦Exports with labeling deviations ◦Special statements and claims 10', '\uf0d8A temporary label approval may be granted for labels with a regulatory deviation that does not pose any potential health, safety, or dietary problems to the consumer \uf0d8Approval not to exceed 180 days •Plant transfers are granted for up to 60 days \uf0d8Temporary label approval granted on a caseby-case basis 11', '\uf0d8 Approval process unchanged by the new generic labeling rule \uf0d8 FSIS assesses the public health risk and potential economic adulteration when deciding to grant approval for the use of a temporary label \uf0d8 The regulations are not specific enough to assist establishments in determining when a temporary label may be granted \uf0d8 For these reasons, FSIS is not expanding the scope of generic labeling approval to include temporary label approvals and extensions. 12', '\uf0d8 Religious-exempt product (poultry) does not receive the mark of inspection and, therefore, deviates from the general labeling requirements for meat and poultry products \uf0d8 Labels for religious-exempt product must be submitted to LPDS for sketch approval \uf0d8 Ritually-slaughtered meat and poultry products receive the mark of inspection (Kosher, Halal) and may be approved generically provided that they don’t meet one of the other labeling categories requiring sketch approval 13', '\uf0d8 Exports of U.S. meat and poultry products occur under agreements between the U.S. government and foreign governments \uf0d8 Agreements require U.S. government approval of labels on meat and poultry products to be exported bearing labeling deviations \uf0d8 Includes ensuring that any changes made to labels on meat and poultry products are allowed per the importing country’s laws (9 CFR 317.7 and 381.128) \uf0d8 Labels marked “for export only” that bear labeling deviations and therefore cannot be used domestically must be sketch approved by LPDS 14', '\uf0d8Detailed list of special statements and claims requiring LPDS approval and examples of claims eligible for generic approval is available on FSIS website http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/bf1707 61-33e3-4a2d-8f86-940c2698e2c5/Comp-GuideLabeling-Evaluation-Approval.pdf?MOD=AJPERES \uf0d8List includes commonly used special statements and claims 15', 'Examples of special statements and claims: o3rd party raising claims or programs (i.e. Global Animal partnership, AMS Process verified or certified programs, American Heart Association (AHA) claims) oClaims regarding meat and poultry production practices (i.e. claims regarding the raising of animals such as “no antibiotics administered” or “vegetarian fed”) oBreed claims (Berkshire, Angus, Hereford, etc) oCertified claims, Certified Halal oGluten free: both certified and non certified oHealth claims defined in 21 CFR Subpart E, e.g. dietary saturated fat and cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease (21 CFR 101.75) 16', 'oImplied Nutrition Claims for example Heart Smart, Baked Not Fried, Made without Butter oStatements that identify a product as “organic” or containing organic ingredients oInstructional or disclaimer statements concerning pathogens, such as “for cooking only”;

Yes. Previously approved labels containing special statements or claims may be generically approved if the modifications to the label are unrelated to the special statement or claim. 40', 'May the establishment number be changed generically from one establishment number to another in the case of a label bearing a special statement or claim? For example, may Plant B use an approved label from Plant A by simply changing the Establishment number from A to B? Yes, this may be permitted under certain circumstances. If Plant B obtains a complete copy of the original label application and all associated supporting documentation necessary to support any special statements or claims on the original application approved for Plant A, then Plant B would have a complete label record on file and would be permitted to change the Est. number from A to B. In this case the information contained within the labeling application would be expected to remain the same (e.g. HACCP category, product formulation, processing procedures). 41', 'Labels with negative claims must be submitted to FSIS for approval. How does FSIS define “negative claims” ? “Negative” labeling claims are defined in the Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book. Negative claims refer to statements highlighting the absence of an ingredient or another constituent of the food, an example of which, “gluten free,” has been codified in 9 CFR 412.1 (e). “No milk” is another example of a negative claim that highlights the absence of an ingredient or another constituent of a food. A negative claim may also identify the absence of certain types of ingredients e.g. “no preservatives” or “no artificial coloring” based on the product formulation. NOTE: Nutrient content claims (e.g. fat free, cholesterol free) are not considered negative claims under the Policy Book entry. 42', 'Is the child nutrition (CN) box on a meat or poultry product considered a special statement or claim and require sketch approval? No. The CN information in CN boxes is reviewed and evaluated for approval by the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), removing it from the realm of a special statement or claim. 43', 'May statements on labels that are defined in FSIS’s regulations or the Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book be generically approved? With the exceptions of “natural” and negative claims, yes, defined statements may be approved generically. Examples of such claims that will no longer require sketch approval by FSIS include: ◦A statement that characterizes a product’s nutrient content that is consistent with the applicable Agency regulations, such as “low fat” ◦Addition of a nutrition facts panel to a product sold at retail ◦A statement that has geographical significance, such as “Italian Style” 44', 'Do non-standardized products still require LPDS Sketch approval? The fact that a product does not have a standard described in the FSIS Food Standards and Labeling Policy Book or specified in the regulations has no bearing on whether or not the label requires sketch approval. A non-standardized meat or poultry product may be generically approved provided it does not fall into one or more of the four categories of labels requiring approval in 9 CFR 412.1(c): temporary approval, labels for export with labeling deviations, religious exempt, or labels bearing special statements or claims. 45', 'Will allergen statements require approval by LPDS staff? No. FSIS will not view the addition of an allergen statement (e.g., “contains soy”) applied in accordance with the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act (FALCPA) as a special statement or claim that requires sketch approval. 46', 'Will labels containing foreign languages on products for sale in the US that do not have special statements or claims require prior approval by LPDS staff? No. While the previous meat and poultry inspection regulations did not permit the generic approval of a label adding or deleting a direct translation of the English language into a foreign language for product sold in the U.S., this final rule will allow it. These types of labels do not fall into any of the categories of labels that must be submitted to FSIS for evaluation and review. 47', 'Do front-of-package labeling statements that meet the requirements for nutrient content claims, including statements of quantity, qualify for generic approval? No. FSIS considers certain front-of-pack (FOP) labeling statements, such as those highlighting select nutrients from the nutrition facts panel placed on the principal display panel, to be nutrient content claims. However, unlike traditional nutrient content claims, such as “low fat,” that are defined in FSIS regulations, there are no guidelines for the multiple types of FOP labeling statements on labeling. 48', 'What are the record keeping requirements for generically approved label? Establishments are required to keep records of all labeling, both generically approved and approved by FSIS, along with the product formulation and processing procedures, as prescribed in 9 CFR 320.1(b)(11), 381.175(b)(6), and 412.1. The final rule added the requirement that any additional documentation needed to support that the labels are consistent with the Federal meat and poultry regulations and policies on labeling also be kept. 49', '• FSIS Labeling Website: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/regulatory- compliance/labeling • Guide to Federal Food Labeling Requirements for Meat, Poultry and Egg Products: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/f4af7c74-2b9f-4484-bb16fd8f9820012d/Labeling_Requirements_Guide.pdf?MOD=AJPERES • Final Rule: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/3b0efaeb-9a81-4532-a1ccb4d1cdb30f4a/2005-0016F.pdf?MOD=AJPERES • Questions submitted through askFSIS : http://askfsis.custhelp.com • Call LPDS at (301) 504-0878 50']"
