This guide will help importers comply with the requirements for bringing these products into the United States. Importers that do not follow this guide may not be able to get products of this type into the United States. Background The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) regulates meat, poultry, and processed egg products under statutory authority of the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA), the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA), and the Egg Products Inspection Act (EPIA). Recent food safety incidents involving what are traditionally considered low-risk food products, including the intentional contamination of powdered milk with melamine distributed worldwide, means that FSIS must be vigilant to protect American consumers by ensuring the safety of all products under its jurisdiction. Under the FMIA, PPIA and the EPIA, those attempting to import food products into the U.S. that contain meat, poultry, or egg product ingredients must ensure that these ingredients are from an approved source. To be from an approved source, the meat, poultry, or egg product ingredient must have been prepared under FSIS inspection or under a foreign inspection system that has been found to be equivalent by FSIS. FSIS has recently discovered that, for various reasons, products containing small amounts of cooked meat or poultry ingredients have entered the country without an assurance that the products are from an approved source. Beginning on June 22, 2009, importers of food products that contain small amounts of meat or poultry will not be granted an import permit by the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) unless a determination is first made by FSIS that the meat, poultry, or egg product ingredient was prepared under specific conditions that will ensure that these ingredients are not adulterated. Once the determination has been made, food products that contain only a small amount of a meat, poultry, or egg product ingredient are no longer subject to the jurisdiction of FSIS and are then subject to the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration.', '4 Import Permit Overview This guide has been prepared to inform you about how products containing very small amounts of meat, poultry, or processed egg products will be treated when offered for import to the United States. The meat, poultry, or egg product ingredient has always needed to come from an approved source. FSIS, however, has always played a secondary role to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s APHIS in ensuring that this is the case. Recent developments have pointed to a problem with this approach. Beginning on June 22, 2009, FSIS will play a direct role in verifying that product comes from an approved source. This guide is designed to help you understand what FSIS will be looking for in the way of documentation of the source of the meat or poultry product ingredient, and how the process for importing your products to the United States will be affected by FSIS involvement. Beginning on June 22, the following two steps will apply to product containing a small amount of meat or poultry products. 1. The meat or poultry ingredient must originate from an approved source, i.e., must be prepared under FSIS inspection or prepared in a certified establishment in an equivalent foreign inspection system. 2. APHIS restricts some products from entering the United States because of animal disease conditions in the country of origin. Therefore, it will continue to be necessary to contact the APHIS Veterinary Services, National Center for Import and Export, for information on restrictions related to animal diseases and to obtain a permit from APHIS. APHIS regulates imports under statutory authority of the Animal Health Protection Act to ensure that they do not pose a risk to U.S. animal health, and issues a veterinary permit to import meat, poultry, or processed egg products into the United States. An application is made through USDA VS Form 16-3. There are some countries that have no animal disease concerns and therefore do not require an APHIS permit. Nevertheless the product must still originate from equivalent countries and establishments certified to export to the United States. For those products for which a new permit is being sought after June 22, APHIS will not approve the permit until the importer provides assurance for food products that contain a small amount of meat or poultry that the meat or poultry ingredient was produced from an approved source (i.e., prepared under either FSIS inspection in the United States or from a certified establishment from a country approved as having a system equivalent to that of the United States). If documentation can be provided that the meat or poultry ingredient included in a food product comes from an approved source, it can be imported to the United States. APHIS will issue permits for these types of products once FSIS determines that the conditions for import are met. Although some food products containing a small amount of meat, poultry, or processed egg product ingredient may not pose a threat to animal health, and would be approved for an APHIS-issued veterinary permit (VS Form 16-6A), they may', '5 still not be approved for entry into the United States because these ingredients were not prepared under inspection systems designed to ensure that these ingredients are not adulterated. In other words, they may meet APHIS entry requirements but not meet FSIS entry requirements. While a permit may have been issued based on an attestation by the importer of an approved source of the meat or poultry ingredient, it is still the responsibility of the importer to possess documentation for every shipment of product. FSIS will continue to seek and detain imported products that contain a small amount of meat or poultry ingredient from non-approved sources that have entered the United States. This has been and will continue to be FSIS’ enforcement strategy. How We Will Proceed A transition period of 90 days that began on March 19, 2009, and will extend until June 22, 2009, is being provided before instituting the new import permit application procedure. During this 90-day period, APHIS will provide a 90-day extension for any currently expired import permits, and permits that expire before June 22, 2009, without modification of the current APHIS permit language referencing the need to consult with FSIS regarding compliance with regulatory requirements. After June 22, 2009, importers must be able to provide documented evidence to support the origin of the meat and/or poultry ingredient used in the food product before the APHIS permit is issued. Also after June 22, 2009, in accordance with normal surveillance procedures of product that has entered the United States (for both products that require APHIS permits and products that do not require an APHIS veterinary permit), the importer will need to provide upon request documentation to demonstrate that the meat or poultry ingredient used in the specific product was derived from an approved source. Beginning on June 23, 2009, which is after the 90-day extension granted by APHIS, APHIS will forward the permit application, VS Form 16-3, to FSIS to verify that the meat or poultry ingredient is from an approved source. FSIS will review the application and work with the applicant to ensure that the applicant fully understands what documentation is needed. It is the applicant’s responsibility to provide documented evidence of an approved source to FSIS. The APHIS system allows supporting documentation to be attached. The applicant may save time in the application process by submitting the proper documentation at the time application for a permit is made. As stated above, FSIS will review the documentation and verify that the meat or poultry food product ingredients originated from an approved source. If importers can provide documented evidence that the meat or poultry ingredient included in a food product comes from an approved source, it can be imported into the United States, regardless of the equivalency status of the country producing or exporting the final product. If this condition is not met, the imported food', '6 will not be considered approved for importation into U.S. commerce, and APHIS will deny approval of the permit. Questions may be directed to FSIS at permits@fsis.usda.gov or at (888)-287-7194. Supporting Documentation The importer will be expected to attest to FSIS that the meat or poultry product ingredient is from an approved source. To do so, the importer will need to support the attestation with evidence that the meat or poultry product ingredient came under FSIS inspection or from a certified establishment in an equivalent country. The documentation used to provide this support can take various forms. An importer may provide a bill of lading, an invoice from the producing establishment, or a statement to this effect from a government agency in the country in which the ingredient originated or the finished product originated. At a minimum, however, the documents will need to provide a basis for determining: • The country of origin of the meat or poultry product ingredient, and • The establishment where the meat or poultry product ingredient was processed In addition, if the importer has applied for an APHIS permit, the valid APHIS Permit Application Reference Number needs to be referenced on all supporting documentation. FSIS provides additional examples of the types of documents that may be used to demonstrate that a product is from an approved source in the Appendix. Once again, if there are any questions regarding the type of documentation needed, please contact FSIS at permits@fsis.usda.gov or at (888)-287-7194. How to Apply for an APHIS Permit Importers may apply for an APHIS import permit by completing and submitting the permit application (VS Form 16-3) to APHIS. The application form may be found on the APHIS Web site at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/. Importers may complete the application manually by downloading and faxing the form to (301) 734-8226. The application may also be completed and submitted via ePermits. ePermits is a Web-based system that allows users to apply for a permit online, check the status of the application, view issued permits or other responses, and more. It uses a USDA-wide system for login called USDA eAuthentication. To use ePermits for most application permit types, you will need to register for an eAuthentication account with Level 2 access. For more information, go to the “Register to Use ePermits” page at http://www.eauth.egov.usda.gov/eauthCreateAccount.html.', '7 VS import permit applications, VS Form 16-3, may also be obtained by writing to the Import/Export Animal Products Program at: USDA, APHIS, VS National Center for Import and Export Products Program 4700 River Road, Unit 40 Riverdale, MD 20737-1231 For further information or questions concerning import applications, contact the Animal Products Program at (301) 734-3277 or by facsimile at (301) 734-8226.

Box 3334, Minneapolis, MN 55403. Next Steps For products containing processed egg products as ingredients, FSIS expects to not implement procedures for several months due to the more complicated process of ascertaining whether processed eggs or shell eggs are used in the food products. For the next 12-18 months, FSIS will conduct outreach to importers, manufacturers of products containing small amounts of meat and poultry ingredients, industry associations, and other interested parties. FSIS also intends to evaluate trade impacts and publish a Federal Register document that will solicit public comments with respect to the requirement that importers shipping food products to the United States that contain small amounts of meat, poultry, or processed egg ingredients ensure that these ingredients are from an approved source, produced under sanitary conditions, and in a secure environment.', '8 Appendix', '9 Examples of Supporting Documentation The following are some examples of the documentation that importers will need to submit to FSIS and APHIS.', '10 A Product Formulation May Be Used to Provide Evidence of the Proportion of Meat, Poultry, or Processed Egg Product Ingredients in the Product Formulation', '', '11 An Export Certificate or a Health Certificate May Be Used to Identify the Country of Origin of Meat, Poultry, or Processed Egg Product Ingredients and to Identify the Establishment Where the Meat, Poultry, or Processed Egg Product Ingredients Were Processed', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', '12 A Product Label May Be Used to Provide Evidence that the Product Labeling Does Not Represent the Finished Product as a Meat Food Product, Poultry Food Product, or Egg Product', '', '13 Selected Sections of FSIS Statutes Poultry Products Inspection Act Title 21 of the United States Code, Section 453 (21 U.S.C. 453) Sec. 453.

All food products for human consumption made using a small amount of meat, poultry or processed egg product ingredients for which these ingredients were not prepared under the U.S. inspection system or a certified establishment from an approved foreign food regulatory system are not eligible to enter the United States. USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) regulates imports of products of animal origin under statutory authority of the Animal Health Protection Act (AHPA) to ensure they do not pose a risk to U.S. animal health. Although some food products containing a small amount of meat, poultry, or processed egg product ingredient may not pose a threat to animal health and would be eligible for an APHIS-issued permit (VS Form 16-6A), they may remain ineligible for entry into the United States because these ingredients were not prepared under inspection systems designed to ensure that these ingredients are not adulterated. While FSIS statutes provide authority to exempt certain foods containing relatively small amounts of meat, poultry or processed egg product ingredients from FSIS inspection, FSIS must ensure that these ingredients are not adulterated. Accordingly, the meat, poultry, and/or processed egg product ingredient(s) used in FSIS-exempted products must be prepared under USDA/FSIS inspection or under a foreign inspection system approved by FSIS. A list of countries eligible to export meat, poultry or egg products to the United States (i.e., amenable food products generally composed of more than a small amount of meat or, poultry, or processed egg product ingredient, or is represented as a meat food product or poultry food product) is published on the FSIS web site at the following address: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/PDF/Countries_Products_Eligible_for_Export.pdf The eligibility of the origin of the meat or poultry ingredient is a condition stated on the permit(s) issued by APHIS Veterinary Services (VS). Effective March 19, 2009, any permit issued on and after this date by APHIS will have the following condition included: Importer is also responsible for obtaining any required authorization from the USDA, Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). Meat, poultry, or egg product ingredients used in FSIS-exempted products must be prepared under USDA, FSIS inspection or under a foreign inspection system approved by FSIS. Contact FSIS via e-mail at: permits@fsis.usda.gov or by telephone at: 888 287 7194 for information regarding approved foreign inspection systems and foreign establishments approved by FSIS to export to the United States. A list of countries eligible to import meat, poultry or egg products is published on the FSIS web site at the following address: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/PDF/Countries_Products_Eligible_for_Export.pdf Importers must be able to provide documented evidence, upon request by FSIS, to support the origin of the meat and/or poultry ingredient used in the food product(s) identified on the APHIS permit.', 'FSIS Notice of IEnforcement for Exempted Products Page 2 As part of an enhanced enforcement program for food products containing a small amount of meat or poultry, any new permit application submitted to APHIS after June 19, 2009, will be reviewed and approved by FSIS to ensure the meat and/or poultry ingredient originates from an eligible source. The importer will provide to FSIS the supporting documentation that is necessary to allow the food product to enter the United States. If this condition is not met, the imported food will be considered ineligible for importation into U.S. commerce. Ineligible product found in commerce may be subject to destruction. Note that APHIS is providing a 90-day extension for any permit that expires on or before June 19, 2009. At the end of the 90-day extension, the importer will be required to submit a new application, which will comply with the conditions outlined above. Further, the implementation of the enhanced enforcement program for products containing a small amount of processed egg products will be forthcoming and likely reflect those for product containing a small amount of meat or poultry. The effective date for food products containing small amounts of processed egg products will be provided by USDA prior to implementation. Supporting documentation can take various forms, but as a minimum, FSIS will need documents that (1) evidence the proportion of meat, poultry, or processed egg product ingredients in the product formulation, (2) identify the country of origin of these ingredients, (3) identify the establishment where these ingredients were processed, (4) provide assurance that no other meat, poultry, or processed egg product ingredient is incorporated into the finished product, (5) evidence that the product labeling does not represent the finished product as a meat food product, poultry food product, or egg product, (6) identify of the facility where the finished product, as represented by the labeling, was manufactured, and (7) for products labeled as flavored, provide assurance that such products do not actually contain a meat, poultry, or processed egg ingredient. In addition, the valid APHIS Permit Number [or Application Reference Number] needs to be referenced on all supporting documentation. It should be noted that this enhanced enforcement program does not include food products flavored to resemble meat, poultry or processed egg products if such food products do not actually contain a meat, poultry or processed egg product ingredient. Also, the program does not include products not intended for use as human food such pet feed or pharmaceuticals.

To: Importers, Brokers, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Other Interested Parties On January 30, 2009, the USDA, APHIS, VS at the request of the USDA, FSIS cancelled certain import permits for FSIS exempted food products containing poultry ingredients. At the same time, VS suspended the issuance of permit applications submitted to APHIS, VS, National Center for Import and Export (NCIE) for all FSIS exempted food products containing small amounts of meat and poultry ingredients. As you are aware, USDA, APHIS regulates products of animal origin under statutory authority of the Animal Health Protection Act to ensure they do not pose a risk to U.S. animal health. USDA, FSIS regulates domestic and imported meat, poultry, and processed egg products under statutory authority of the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, and the Egg Products Inspection Act for public health. Together, APHIS and FSIS have implemented several policy changes to ensure that imported animal origin products do not pose a risk to either US animal health or public health. For those importers of FSIS exempted food products that contain small amounts of meat and poultry ingredients, FSIS and APHIS have revised how such permits will be issued. The recent suspension of the permitting process has caused a backlog in processing applications and we regret the inconvenience. We are currently processing all permit applications that we receive. Please be advised that all permit applications for FSIS exempted food products containing small amounts of meat and poultry ingredients submitted to APHIS after June 19, 2009, will be reviewed by FSIS prior to APHIS issuing permits. As part of the new process, after permit applications are submitted to APHIS, they must be reviewed and approved by FSIS to ensure the meat and/or poultry ingredients in such food products originate from an eligible source, i.e., prepared under FSIS inspection or in a foreign establishment certified by a foreign inspection system approved by FSIS. Importers will be required to provide documented evidence directly to FSIS to support the origin of the meat and/or poultry ingredient used in the food product(s) identified on the APHIS permit application. If this condition is not met, FSIS will advise APHIS that the imported food product is ineligible for importation into U.S. commerce, and a permit will not be issued.
