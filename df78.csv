This includes 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths. • Contaminated meat and poultry are responsible for 22% of these illnesses and 29% of these deaths. • Between 2007 and 2013, FSIS investigated 130 outbreaks of human illness. Of those, 31 (24 percent) were linked to beef ground at a retail venue.', 'Food Safety and Inspection Service: Why Ground Beef? 6 • Ground beef can be produced from materials from multiple suppliers, and multiple production lots. • The grinding process can spread pathogens throughout each lot of ground beef, and between lots if grinding equipment and/or food contact surfaces are not properly cleaned. • Additionally, ground beef is not always cooked sufficiently to destroy pathogens.', 'Food Safety and Inspection Service: Previous Approaches to Retail Recordkeeping 2002: ‘‘E. coli O157:H7 Contamination of Beef Products’’ Federal Register Notice • When collecting a ground beef sample for O157:H7 testing at retail, FSIS announced that it would also gather: –Names and establishment numbers of the establishments supplying the source materials for the lot of ground beef sampled –Supplier lot numbers and production dates –Any other information that would be useful to suppliers if they were later notified of an E. coli O157:H7 positive finding 7', 'Food Safety and Inspection Service: Previous Approaches to Retail Recordkeeping 2009: FSIS provided guidance on its Web site • Recommended that retail stores keep records of: –The lot/batch number of source materials used to prepare raw ground beef –Exact name/type of product produced 8', 'Food Safety and Inspection Service: Why do we need this rule? 9 • It will improve FSIS’ ability to accurately trace the source of foodborne illness outbreaks involving ground beef products and identify the source materials that need to be recalled. • It will provide FSIS with proper documentation in efforts to trace ground beef products back to supplier(s).', 'Food Safety and Inspection Service: Why do we need this rule? 10 •Despite efforts by FSIS, industry associations, and other regulators to provide retailers and official establishments with guidance and examples of best practices, the level of recordkeeping was still less than what was needed for timely and accurate traceability investigations.', 'Food Safety and Inspection Service: • The cleaning and sanitizing of equipment used to grind raw beef is important because it prevents the transfer of E. coli O157:H7 and other bacteria from one lot of product to another. • When records are available and complete, FSIS is often able to identify specific production in an official establishment.
