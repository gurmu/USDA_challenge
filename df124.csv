text_by_page,"['HACCP Model for Raw, Non-Intact Turkey The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) published the Pathogen Reduction/Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) Systems Final Rule in July 1996 mandating all USDA inspected meat and poultry establishments implement a HACCP system. Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) is a systematic and scientific method of process control for the production of safe food products. The HACCP regulations (9 CFR Part 417) require establishments to develop and implement a system of controls designed to improve the safety of their products. The HACCP models’ focus is on product safety, not product quality characteristics. With the rule, FSIS made available a guidebook for the preparation of HACCP plans and a generic model for each food processing category defined in regulation (9 CFR 417.2(b)(1)). The guidebook and the generic models have been revised since their initial publication to be consistent with current science and policy. FSIS recommends you use the updated Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans when developing an establishment-specific HACCP plan. Generic models serve as useful examples of how to meet the regulatory requirements. Each model represents a food processing category. Each processing category may contain numerous products. Therefore, each single model represents a category of products and, as such, the models do not demonstrate unique products or novel processes. The generic models are not intended to be used “as is”. Establishments are to tailor the model(s) to fit the establishment’s operation. This Raw, Non-Intact model uses a ground turkey product to demonstrate hazard analysis and HACCP plan principles. The model may serve as a starting point for any ground poultry product. The model’s critical control points (CCPs) do not necessarily apply to all operations or products. Products or operations may require fewer or more CCPs depending on the operation. The flow diagram demonstrates a general production process and should be modified to reflect the processes used at the establishment. The food safety critical limits selected must come from scientific documents or other reliable sources. This model includes references for guidance on the selection of critical limits. The records produced while documenting a HACCP plan, including all documentation used to support the hazard analysis are HACCP records (CFR 417.5(a)). The selection of processing categories and HACCP models are preliminary steps to completing a hazard analysis. The documents produced during the selection process are HACCP records. Ensure you maintain the documents produced while developing a HACCP plan. For further assistance with developing HACCP plans see the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans and the guidance materials available on the FSIS HACCP webpage.1 1 This information is best suited for small and very small establishments seeking assistance in understanding the requirements in Title 9 Code of Federal Regulations (9 CFR) Part 417. The HACCP model is for demonstration purposes only. The model does not represent requirements that must be met. Establishments are required to develop HACCP plans specific to their facilities, production practices, and products.', 'Page 2 of 12 EXAMPLE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION2 Process Type and Product Name: Raw, Non-Intact Turkey Product Name Fresh or Frozen Ground Turkey (Raw, Non-Intact) Important product characteristics (Aw, pH, Preservatives, etc.) None How it is to be used For further processing at this facility or another establishment or intended for cooking for or by end consumer3 Packaging (durability and storage conditions) Tray packs (Case ready) Shelf life and at what temperature4 7 Days at <40ºF; 180 days at < 0ºF Where it will be sold (Specify intended consumers, especially at-risk populations)5 Sold direct to another establishment or to household consumers through retail outlets or distributed to hotels, restaurants, and institutions (HRI).

The FSIS Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans and the generic HACCP models are intended for small and very small establishments seeking assistance in understanding the requirements in Title 9 Code of Federal Regulations (9 CFR) Part 417. The HACCP models are for demonstration purposes only. The models do not represent requirements that must be met. Establishments are required to develop HACCP plans specific to their facilities, production practices, and products. 3 The intended use or consumer of the product must be identified in accordance with 9 CFR 417.2(a)(2). Identifying the product’s intended use in the product description is one way to meet the regulatory requirements specific to 417.2(a)(2). 4 Each establishment’s products may have their own defined product shelf life. 5 At-risk populations include young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised persons.', 'Page 3 of 12 EXAMPLE LIST OF PRODUCT INGREDIENTS AND INCOMING MATERIAL6 Process Type and Product Name: Raw, Non-Intact Turkey Meat and Meat by-products Turkey trim (dark and light meat, skin on and skin off) from outside source purchase and in-house slaughter operations Non-meat food ingredients None Antimicrobial interventions and processing aids7 Antimicrobial Acid8 Packaging materials Tray packaging, retail plastic packaging and rollstock plastic, self-adhesive labels Restricted ingredients and allergens None Other None DATE: APPROVED BY: 6 List all meat, non-meat ingredients, restricted ingredients (for example, nitrites), processing aids, and packaging material used in production of this product.

To review restrictions on the use of nitrite and sodium ascorbate or sodium erythorbate, see 9 CFR 424.22(b). 7 FSIS and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that establishes the working relationship followed when responding to notifications for the use of food additives (including ingredients) intended for use in the production of FSIS regulated products. FSIS determines the suitability of the use of food ingredients used in the production of meat, poultry, and egg products. FSIS consults, as necessary, with FDA on the requirements under the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations. See FSIS Directive 7120.1, Safe and Suitable Ingredients Used in Meat, Poultry and Egg Products for the list of suitable ingredients. 8 Antimicrobial interventions even if considered processing aids must be addressed in the HACCP system.

Rework', 'EXAMPLE HAZARD ANALYSIS12 Raw, Non-Intact Turkey 12 See the FSIS Guideline for Controlling Campylobacter in Raw Poultry, and the FSIS Guideline For Controlling Salmonella in Raw Poultry for best practices and a list of scientific and technical references. 13 Hazards are grouped into three categories: Biological (B), Chemical (C), and Physical (P). Biological hazards are living organisms. Chemical hazards may be naturally occurring in foods, used or added during the processing of foods, or administered to live animals. Physical hazards are a component of a food that is unexpected, such as plastic, glass, metal, or bone in a boneless product. See the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans for more information about hazards identification. 14 Place the justification for your decision in column 4. Control measures for hazards not reasonably likely to occur are entered in column 4. Control measures for hazards reasonably likely to occur are entered in column 5. If a hazard is reasonably likely to occur, then a CCP must be addressed at this step or a later step. See FSIS Meat and Poultry Hazards and Controls Guide for a list of frequently used controls. 15 Scientific references are important in making decisions, providing justifications, and validating the HACCP system. When scientific references are used for decisions, the referenced article must be part of the HACCP records. If the scientific justification is from FSIS, then list the document name. If justification is not from FSIS, then HACCP system design must be supported by documentary evidence – that is, the theoretical principles, expert advice from processing authorities, scientific or technical data, peer-reviewed journal articles, pathogen modeling programs, or other information demonstrating that particular process control measures can adequately prevent, reduce, or eliminate specific hazards. These non-FSIS supporting documents must be kept for the life of the HACCP plan. 16 Because the results obtained under prerequisite programs could affect decisions made in the hazard analysis, an establishment is required to maintain records associated with these programs as supporting documentation for its hazard analysis (9 CFR 417.5(a)). When an establishment determines that a potential hazard is not reasonably likely to occur because the implementation of a prerequisite program (e.g., Sanitation standard operating procedures (Sanitation SOP), written sanitary dressing procedures incorporated into prerequisite programs, purchase specifications, or antimicrobial interventions) prevents conditions that make the potential hazard likely, that prerequisite program then becomes part of the HACCP system and as a result, must be validated. This means that establishments must maintain scientific or technical support for the design of those prerequisite programs used to support decisions in the hazard analysis and must collect in-plant validation data to support that the programs are implemented as designed (see FSIS Compliance Guideline HACCP Systems Validation, page 5). 17 To determine a CCP, see FSIS Guidebook for the Development of HACCP Plans for decision tree to evaluate the areas of control (column 5) to determine the best CCP to control, reduce, or eliminate a hazard.

However, if an establishment implements different critical operational parameters in the process from the scientific support, or the scientific support identified does not contain microbiological data, then the establishment should collect in-plant data demonstrating the critical operational parameters that it has implemented can all be met AND should collect in-plant microbiological validation data or identify scientific support with microbiological data that demonstrates the effectiveness of those implemented critical operational parameters (FSIS Compliance Guideline HACCP Systems Validation, page 27). 21 Provide reference for scientific support and validation for effective concentrations and support for critical operational parameters that reduce biological hazards. FSIS Directive 7120.1, Safe and Suitable Ingredients Used in Meat, Poultry and Egg Products contains the list of substances that may be used in the production of meat and poultry products. The list contains the allowable amounts and the intended use of the approved antimicrobials. The list (Directive 7120.1) can be used as supporting documentation for chemical hazard controls (safety and suitability). Directive 7120.1 cannot be used as support for the control of biological hazards because the antimicrobial concentration needed to control bacteria is different from the concentrations required for safety and suitability.', 'Step Potential Hazard RLTO Justification / Basis Controls CCP Page 8 of 12 P: None 4.

These controls should be evident within the written document upon review. The Grinder SOP and plant data related to on-going verification activities then become part of recordkeeping and historical data. 23 Note: this “historical data” must be supported with evidence from the establishment through the establishment’s history or validation data with reference to the actual SOP (which is a prerequisite program). When historical data is not available (for example, a HACCP plan for a new process or product), then system design must be supported by other documentary evidence. Documentary evidence such as the FSIS Meat and Poultry Hazards and Controls Guide, which states “appropriate screening procedure for monitoring equipment” is a frequently used control for foreign material hazards when grinding products.', 'Step Potential Hazard RLTO Justification / Basis Controls CCP Page 9 of 12 6.
