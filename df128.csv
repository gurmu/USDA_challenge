text_by_page,"['HACCP Model for Fully Cooked—Not Shelf Stable Roast Beef The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) published the Pathogen Reduction/Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) Systems Final Rule in July 1996 mandating all USDA inspected meat and poultry establishments implement a HACCP system. HACCP is a systematic and scientific method of process control for the production of safe food products. The HACCP regulations (9 CFR Part 417) require establishments to develop and implement a system of controls designed to improve the safety of their products. The HACCP models’ focus is on product safety, not product quality characteristics. With the rule, FSIS made available aguidebook for the preparation of HACCP plans and ageneric model for each food processing category defined in the regulation (9 CFR 417.2(b)(1)). The guidebook and the generic models have been revised since their initial publication to be consistent with current science and policy. FSIS recommends you use the updated Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans when developing an establishment-specific HACCP plan. Generic models serve as useful examples of how to meet the regulatory requirements. Each model represents a food processing category. Each processing category may contain numerous products. Therefore, each single model represents a category of products and, as such, the models do not demonstrate unique products or novel processes. The generic models are not intended to be used “asis”. Establishments are to tailor the model(s) to fit the establishment’s operation. This Fully Cooked—NotShelf Stable HACCP model applies to products that receive a full lethality heatprocess step to achieve food safety. The full lethality heat process step makes these products safe to eat with no further preparation required by the consumer. However, these products are not shelf stable. Therefore,these products must be frozen or refrigerated throughout their shelf-life to maintain product safety. These products also meet the definition ofready-to-eat(RTE) product, as defined in 9 CFR 430.1. The Fully Cooked—Not Shelf Stable model’s critical control points (CCPs) do not necessarily apply to alloperations or products. Products or operations may require fewer or more CCPs depending on the operation. The flow diagram demonstrates a general production process and should be modified to reflect the processes used at the establishment. The food safety critical limits selected must come from scientific documents or other reliable sources. Each model includes references for guidance on the selection of critical limits. The records produced while documenting a HACCP plan, including all documentation used to support the hazard analysis, are HACCP decisionmaking records (CFR 417.5(a)). The selection of a HACCP model is a preliminary step to completing a hazard analysis. The documents produced during the selection process are HACCP records. Ensure you maintain the documents produced while developing a HACCP plan. For further assistance with developing HACCP plans see the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans and the guidance materials available on the FSIS HACCP webpage.1 1This information is best suited for small and very small establishments seeking assistance in understanding the requirements in Title 9 Code of Federal Regulations (9 CFR)Part 417. TheHACCP model is for demonstration purposes only. The model does not represent requirements that mustbe met. Establishments are required to develop HACCPplans specific to their facilities, production practices, and products.

To review restrictionson the use ofnitrite and sodium ascorbate or sodium erythorbate, see 9 CFR 424.22(b). 8FSIS and theFood and Drug Administration (FDA) have a memorandum ofunderstanding (MOU) that establishes the working relationship followed when responding to notifications for the use of food additives(including ingredients)intended for use in the production of FSIS regulated products. FSISdetermines the suitability of the use offood ingredients usedin the production of meat, poultry, and egg products. FSISconsults, as necessary, with FDAon the requirements under theFederalFood, Drug & Cosmetic Actand its implementing regulations. See FSISDirective 7120.1, Safe and Suitable Ingredients Used in Meat, Poultry and Egg Products for the list of suitable ingredients. 9With this model, the establishment does notincorporate allergenic compounds or restricted ingredients into any products and so these ingredientsare not present in the facility. For that reason,thismodel’s hazard analysis does notdemonstrate controls forallergenic compounds or restricted ingredients. Review the HACCPModel for Ready-to-Eat, Heat-Treated, Shelf-Stable (Beef Jerky) to see how allergen controls might be included in a hazard analysis.

Biological hazardsarelivingorganisms. Chemical hazardsmaybe naturallyoccurringin foods, used or addedduring the processingoffoods, or administered to live animals. Physical hazardsare acomponent ofafood that is unexpected, such as plastic, glass, metal, or bone in a boneless product. See the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans for more information about hazards identification. 14Place thejustification for your decision in column 4. Control measureseither go in column 4 for hazards not reasonably likely to occuror go incolumn 5 for hazards reasonably likely to occur. If ahazardis reasonable likely to occur, then a CCPmust be addressed at this step or a later step. See FSISMeat and Poultry Hazards and Controls Guide for a list of frequently used controls. 15Scientific references are important in making decisions, providing justifications, and validating the HACCPsystem. When scientific references are used for decisions, the referencedarticle must be part ofthe HACCP records. If the scientificjustificationis from FSIS, then list the document name. If justificationis not from an FSIS source, then HACCP system design must be supported by documentary evidence –that is,the theoretical principles, expert advice from processing authorities, scientific or technical data, peerreviewed journal articles, pathogen modeling programs, or other information demonstrating that particular process control measures can adequately prevent, reduce, or eliminate specific hazards. These non-FSIS supporting documents must be kept for the life of the HACCP plan. 16Because the results obtained under prerequisite programs could affect decisions made in the hazard analysis, an establishmentis required to maintain records associated with theseprograms as supporting documentation for its hazard analysis (9 CFR 417.5(a)). When an establishment determines that a potential hazard is not reasonably likely tooccur because the implementation of a prerequisite program (e.g., Sanitation SOP,written sanitary dressing procedures incorporatedinto prerequisite programs, purchase specifications, antimicrobial interventions) prevents conditions that make the potential hazard likely, that prerequisite program then becomes part of the HACCP system and as a result, must be validated. This means thatestablishments must maintain scientific or technical support for the design of those prerequisiteprograms used to supportdecisions in the hazard analysis and must collect in-plant validation data to support that the programs are implemented as designed (see FSIS Compliance Guideline HACCP Systems Validation, page 5). 17 An annualupdate fora LOG is nota regulatoryrequirement. Eachestablishmentmust determine the frequencyat whichthe LOG are updated. The frequency should be sufficient to adequately describe the supplier’s process to support the decision(s) made.

Such historical records are often gathered as partof in-plant validation (9 CFR417.4(a)(1).

Product monitored with a probe thermometer is reworked and recooked before distribution per Written Rework Procedures SOP to ensure no post-lethality exposed product is in commerce. Limit heating come-uptime (50°F to 130°F) to less than 6 hours to ensure S. aureus outgrowth is limited to 2logs or less (see FSIS Revised Appendix 23, 24 A).

For a model HACCPplan thataddresses relative humidityfollowing one of the options inthe Revised Appendix A,see the HACCPModel for Ready-to-Eat, Heat-treated, Shelf-stable (Beef Jerky). 23Ifan establishment implements a process consistent with the process specifications described in the scientific support, and the scientificsupport contains microbiological data specifying the level of pathogen reduction achieved by the intervention strategy for the target pathogen identified in the hazard analysis, the in-plant data collected during the 90 day initial validation period will consist of data on quantifiable characteristics of the critical operational parameters, suchas pressure, temperature, and concentration. However, if an establishment implements different criticaloperational parameters in the process from the scientific support, or the scientific support identified does not contain microbiological data, thenthe establishmentmust collect in-plant data demonstrating the critical operational parameters that ithas implemented can all be met AND should collect in-plant microbiologicaldata or identify scientific support with microbiological data that demonstrates the effectiveness of those implemented criticaloperational parameters (FSIS Compliance Guideline HACCPSystems Validation, page 27). 24Establishments producing products with long heating come-up-times due to product size,such as hamand beef brisket, can use the critical operating parameters found on page 48 of the FSISCooking Guideline for Meat and PoultryProducts (Revised AppendixA). This reference canbe used assupportforapplying FSIS’ applicable time-temperature combinations and relative humidity, without considering heating come-up-time as a critical operating parameter. 25See FSIS Cooking Guideline for Meatand Poultry Products (Revised Appendix A) for validated times and temperatures.
