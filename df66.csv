Industry User Guide 1 Introduction Primary Business Function The Label Submission and Approval System (LSAS) is a web-based software application that integrates and implements an electronic label application process for establishments to submit label applications. LSAS allows LPDS personnel to view, evaluate, and adjudicate all electronically submitted Label Application Packages (LAPs) and Appeal Packages (APs) efficiently and accurately. Industry users will be able to check on the status of their application via their web browser without calling LPDS. Also, the submitter can utilize the Generic Label Advisor to determine whether an application can be generically approved. Industry users that will be accessing LSAS include establishments, expeditors, label consultants, and small businesses. To use LSAS, all users are required to have an eAuthentication (eAuth) user ID and password. Users of LSAS will be required to have a USDA Level 2 eAuthentication account to access the system. USDA eAuth is the system used by USDA agencies to enable FSIS staff, customers, and contractors to obtain accounts that will allow them to access USDA web applications and services via the Internet.

The author has gone through great effort to minimize the possibility of using branded names, establishment numbers, approval numbers, and any other relevant FSIS Label Application Form 7234 information. If such match should occur, then it was purely coincidental. September 09, 2019 5 Chapter 1 – Introduction', 'Label Submission and Approval System (LSAS) Industry User Guide 2 System Capabilities The USDA FSIS LPDS develops and provides labeling guidance, policies, and inspection methods, and it administers programs to protect consumers from misbranded and economically adulterated meat, poultry, and egg products to ensure that all labels are truthful and not misleading. Labeling includes all forms of product identification, health-related claims, net weight, species identification, and nutrition. LSAS is a web-based software application that integrates and implements an electronic label application process for establishments to submit label applications and appeals. Through LSAS, LPDS personnel will view, evaluate, and adjudicate all electronically submitted LAPs and APs efficiently and accurately. An adjudicated LAP’s results and status will appear on the user’s home page. Using LSAS, LPDS will be able to process label applications more efficiently. The required functionalities for this system include submitting label applications via the web, querying for a label application’s status and information, downloading LAPs and supporting documents to a portable format, and exporting search results to a spreadsheet of submitted LAPs. The LSAS application serves as a searchable database when seeking information about products or establishments. Label information includes product identification, special claims, processes, geographical origin claims, guarantees, net weight, ingredient list, species identification, and nutritional information. LSAS provides a central tracking system for establishments and LPDS leadership. To a certain extent, LSAS replaces almost all paper-and email-based processes. Purpose The LSAS application provides the following benefits: • Establishments can submit applications and supporting materials via the Internet. • The Generic Label Advisor can be utilized for previously approved labels. • Establishments and LPDS can check on an electronically submitted LAP’s or AP’s status via the Internet. • Data from the FSIS 7234 label application form is stored in a central electronic database that can be electronically queried and reported. The information that can be queried includes ingredients, processes, special claims, and other specific label-related information. This guide provides detailed instructions for performing label application submission tasks and others, as listed above. September 09, 2019 7 Chapter 2 – System Capabilities', 'Label Submission and Approval System (LSAS) Industry User Guide Roles LSAS is a role-based system. User authentication (login and logout) is the foundation of LSAS’s role-based access. Each user’s screen display, privileges, and the scope of functionality is based on his or her specific work assignments, responsibilities, and role within LSAS. There are various classes of users who will interact with LSAS. Factors that define a user class include responsibilities, skill level, work activities, and mode of interaction with the system. The role that you are associated with in LSAS determines the permissions that you have in LSAS. The options available on the left side navigation panel of LSAS’s home page and the functions you can access vary based on your LSAS role. LSAS provides a “Submitter” role for Industry users. Assumption Users of LSAS will be required to have a USDA Level 2 eAuthentication (eAuth) account to access the system, depending on the type of access required. USDA eAuth is the system used by USDA agencies to enable FSIS staff, customers, and contractors to obtain accounts that will allow them to access USDA web applications and services via the Internet. eAuth confirms a person’s identity and authorization identifies the person’s user permissions. The LSAS application will leverage the USDA eAuthentication Service.

Figure 3-10 illustrates the Select a Profile screen. Profiles can be created by the user. All that is required is a name for the organization or establishment. Organizational profiles are essentially label application containers. A user will always be logged in under a particular profile, and any label applications he or she submits while logged in under that profile belong to that profile. It is possible to have more than one profile. As a general rule, a single profile should not be used for multiple establishments that are for different organizations. A new profile should be created for each establishment. However, a single profile can have multiple establishments, but this should be limited to cases in which all of the establishments fall under the same parent organization. In order to continue to the LSAS home page, you must select a profile from the list. Select the desired profile, and then click the Submit button. Next, confirm your selection.

Figure 3-13: User\'s Profile Options The Manage Users option is especially valuable when an establishment wants to delegate additional resources for submitting or managing a label application. An establishment’s first LSAS user will generally be the initial contact person. This person will likely be the administrator of any profiles associated with the establishment. It will be the establishment’s responsibility to manage all users associated with that establishment, independently of LPDS. Through LSAS’s profile management function, the establishment’s newly assigned administrator can easily add/assign other establishment resources as LSAS users. These users will be assigned an LSAS role as associates within the establishment. Additionally, in the situation where the establishment farms out its label application process, the establishment’s administrator, using LSAS’s profile tool, can create user profiles for agents/expeditors. Then, the establishment can share certain label applications with a designated agent/expeditor. Also, its LSAS privileges may have limited functionality. The Manage Sharing option allows a user to share his applications with another user. As mentioned in the preceding paragraph, an establishment can share specific applications with its agent once the agent has permission to access LSAS. The Manage Establishments option allows a user to add establishments to his profile. For example, a major corporation will have multiple subsidiaries, so there will be a need to create a separate profile for each of the subsidiaries. This option provides the establishment a way to include its establishment numbers and allows LSAS to easily associate a user with his establishment’s number and address. The establishment number and address is a required field in the Form 7234. LSAS provides a tool to import establishment information directly from PHIS.

The requestee will then have the option to approve or deny the request. Using the Manage Users option, the user receiving the request (the requestee) will approve or deny the request.

Associate An associate is an LSAS user assigned by his organization’s administrator to perform label submission tasks, including checking label status and viewing LAPs.

For a submitter, the pools are Announcements, Application Messages, Drafts, Submitted Applications, Adjudicated Applications, Returns and Rescinded Applications, and Appeals. Dashboard Pools Depending on the user’s role, the Dashboard screen will display specific pools from which the user can access label applications. Some pools are common for all user roles, such as the Announcements and Application Messages pools. Figure 4-3 illustrates a typical Submitter’s Dashboard screen pools.

Please correct and resubmitthe application. Label Submission and Approval System (LSAS) Industry User Guide Application Messages Using LSAS Messages, LPDS technical staff can communicate with industry users regarding any issues for a particular label application. The Application Messages pool on the Dashboard screen will display the most recently created message for each of your label applications (Figure 4-5). This pool is visible to all users, regardless of their user role in LSAS. LPDS will see and respond to any messages you create for your label applications. Figure 4-5: Application Messages Pool For submitters, the Application Messages pool displays the following types of records: • Messages: The most recent message for a label application will appear in the pool. If a label application has multiple associated messages, only the latest message for the label application will appear in the pool. Messages that were created more than 15 days ago will not appear in the Application Messages pool on the dashboard; however, they can still be viewed on the Messages screen that is accessed via the Available Actions menu, as discussed in the Messages section on page 83. • Vet EC comments: If an EC application has been vetted by an EC Gatekeeper, any comment that the EC Gatekeeper entered will appear in the pool. If you click the View button for an application in the Application Messages pool (Figure 4-5), LSAS will display all of that application’s messages in a new window. For example, if the user clicks the View button for the second message shown in the image above, LSAS will display the Label Application Message screen for the associated label application (see Figure 4-6 on the next page); this screen shows all the messages that currently exist for the label application.

The submitter may appeal a Sketch Modified label application. Normally, a returned label application is resubmitted. You can create an appeal for a label application only if LPDS has adjudicated the application to one of the following statuses: “Sketch Modified,” “Return,” “Temporary,” or “Extension of Temporary.” An appeal cannot be created for a label application that LPDS adjudicated as “Sketch.” The “Create Appeal” action does not appear in the Available Actions drop-down list if you have already used up all of the appeal requests (Appeal Levels 1, 2, and 3) for the selected label application. You can create an appeal for a returned application only if the application includes the same, unedited data as the original submission. If LPDS returns a label application, and then you edit the returned application, you will not be able to create an appeal for the edited application. If you edit a returned application, you can resubmit the application with the updated information, but you cannot create an appeal. Once submitted, the appeal is evaluated by an Appeals Handler, a senior level LPDS personnel member. Each appeal will be reviewed to determine whether the reason submitted by the submitter is valid. The Appeal Handler has the option to approve the appeal. Alternatively, the handler can reject the appeal and send the label application back to the submitter. The submitter, upon reviewing the new decision, has the option to reappeal this decision. When a subsequent appeal is submitted, it is escalated to a higher priority/level and will be reviewed by a higher authority in LPDS. If an appealed LAP is approved, then LPDS will change the status to “Approved”. LPDS’s decision will appear in the submitter’s Dashboard.

Effective January 6, 2014, FSIS regulation 9 CFR 412.2 streamlined the label approval process and allowed establishments more flexibility. The generic approval category was expanded so that establishments could use certain labeling without prior FSIS approval. LSAS has incorporated the regulations into a wizard, the Generic Label Advisor, to allow the submitter to determine if a label can be generically approved. The following conditions prohibit a label application from being considered for generic approval: • The product was produced under a religious exemption. • The label is for export only with deviations from domestic requirements. • The label is for temporary approval. • The label bears a special statement or claim that was not previously approved. • Product Type is ""Egg/Other"". • The Product Type is an exotic species under voluntary inspection. NOTE: The Product Type “Egg/Other” includes exotic species. If the Generic Label Advisor (GLA) determines that a label can be generically approved, LSAS will generate a certificate for the establishment to file with its labeling records. If the wizard determines that the label cannot be generically approved, it will display a message stating so. The wizard will also display a Go To Label Application button that you can click to open the LSAS label application screens for the normal submission process. 1. To start the GLA, click the Generic Label Advisor menu option in the left navigation panel.

The information requested is directly inherited from Form 7234. Some additional information is requested to streamline the submission process. A label application consists not only of the Form 7234, but also of a label image(s) and any supporting documentation. LSAS includes functionality to upload any label image and supporting document(s). Once a label application has been submitted, LPDS personnel will review and evaluate it. It is important to include all relevant information and documentation, i.e., special claims, so as not to delay the process and have the LAP returned. The actual application process consists of ten screens, as shown in Figure 7-1. As the Submitter completes all the required fields and saves each screen, LSAS will proceed to the next step (screen). If the submitter does not complete each screen in the process, LSAS will display an error message. Figure 7-1: Go To Drop-down for Accessing the Form 7234 Screens At the end of the process, the Submitter submits the application to LPDS. LSAS displays an acknowledgement that the submission was accepted and assigns an application number for future reference. LAPs will be neither evaluated nor adjudicated unless they are received by LPDS. Once received, LPDS will evaluate the label application and provide an adjudication decision. LSAS will send an email notification to the submitter’s specified Firm or Agent email address to alert them of LPDS’s adjudication decision. NOTE: Email notifications of adjudication decisions will be provided only for those applications that were submitted electronically via LSAS. The sections that follow guide the Submitter through the 7234 application process.

Label Submission and Approval System (LSAS) Industry User Guide • Voluntary Review – If you believe your label application does not require review by FSIS because it complies with generic labeling requirements, then select “Yes” for the question: “Are you requesting a Voluntary Review of a submission which can be generically approved?” o You cannot answer “Yes” to the Voluntary Review question if your label application is for an egg product. o You cannot answer “Yes” to the Voluntary Review question if you selected the Extraordinary Circumstances checkbox. If you are not sure whether your label application meets the minimum requirements to be considered for voluntary review, you can use the Generic Label Advisor Wizard to help you determine whether your label is a valid candidate. For complete details on the GLA Wizard, please see the Generic Label Advisor section on page 95. • Extraordinary Circumstances – If you believe your label application merits expedited evaluation by FSIS, select the Extraordinary Circumstances checkbox. The blue, underlined text is a hyperlink to FSIS’s extraordinary circumstances policy. If you are unsure whether your application qualifies for extraordinary circumstances, click the link to access the policy information to aid you in your decision. All label applications designated as having extraordinary circumstances will be vetted to validate the request. See the Extraordinary Circumstances section on page 129 for more information. The Extraordinary Circumstances checkbox can only be selected on the first (original) submission of a label application. If you select this checkbox on an original submission, then you cannot un-check the checkbox on any subsequent resubmission of the same label application. Likewise, if you did not select the EC checkbox on the original submission, then you cannot select it for a resubmission of the same label application. The same vetting decision that LPDS applied to the original submission will automatically be applied to any resubmission. o You cannot select the Extraordinary Circumstances checkbox if you answered “Yes” to the Voluntary Review question. 6.

For example, if you selected the checkbox for Extraordinary Circumstances on the Product Information screen, then the associated Extraordinary Circumstances option in the drop-down on the Label Documentation screen will appear with an asterisk. \uf075 The filenames of all documents uploaded to the same label application must be unique, even if they have different file formats. LSAS does not recognize differences in uppercase versus lowercase in the names of uploaded files. Example: The filenames for label images and supporting documents cannot be duplicated, even if they are for different file types. Acceptable Name is different; extension is the same Chicken_Nuggets_Image.jpg Chicken_Nuggets_Claim.jpg Unacceptable Name is the same; extension is different Chicken_Nuggets.jpg Chicken_Nuggets.doc chicken_nuggets.pdf This scenario is unacceptable because when LSAS converts the files to PDFs, they will have the exact same name and extension. \uf075 LSAS limits file size to no greater than 5 MB. \uf075 Do not upload password-secured documents. \uf075 Do not upload an image file that has existing annotations or comments. This will prevent you from being able to see LPDS’s annotations, if any exist. \uf075 Printer-ready labels are composed of multiple layers of information. In some cases, a layer consisting of a clear mask or “varnish” overlays all underlying layers. It is important that this layer is disabled or turned off when uploading the image to LSAS.

The EC service alerts LPDS that an establishment requests expedited attention on a label application. The Product Information screen provides a checkbox for the submitter to indicate this request (Figure 7-26). Figure 7-26: Product Information Screen – EC Checkbox If a submitter selects the EC checkbox on the Product Information screen, then documentation to support the EC claim must be attached to the application. The Label Documentation screen will display an additional “Extraordinary Circumstances” value in the documentation type drop-down, and the value will be shown with an asterisk to indicate that it is required (Figure 7-27). Figure 7-27: Label Documentation Screen – Required EC Documentation September 09, 2019 129 Chapter 7 – Submit a Label Application', 'Label Submission and Approval System (LSAS) Industry User Guide LPDS Vetting Process for EC Applications LPDS has a vetting process to determine the legitimacy of each EC request. The vetting stage occurs prior to the evaluation and adjudication process. The purpose of the vetting process is to evaluate whether the circumstance is truly valid. Selection of “Extraordinary Circumstances” is not a means to “resubmit” a returned application. The selection of “Extraordinary Circumstances” should only be chosen if the product has been retained (""tagged"") by program personnel at official establishments or when there is some other unforeseeable impediment to movement of the product, and a temporary label approval would remove the impediment. For complete policy guidance, see the FSIS website: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/regulatory-compliance/labeling/labelingprocedures/procedures-evaluating-labeling See Tip 5 posted in the Announcements pool on how to resubmit a returned application to LPDD. When a submitter specifies that an application is an EC application by checking the extraordinary circumstances checkbox, LSAS will redirect the application to the EC Gatekeeper. The EC Gatekeeper confirms or denies the submitter’s EC request. Any requests that are confirmed will be given priority review. Notes on Resubmitted EC Applications: The system shall allow a submitter to identify a label application as an EC application only on the original submission. • If the submitter did not select the EC checkbox on the original submission, then LSAS will not allow the Submitter to select the EC checkbox for any subsequent resubmission • If an EC request was approved for an original submission, then the submitter will not be allowed to uncheck the EC checkbox for any subsequent resubmission. • If an EC request was denied for an original submission, then the submitter will not be allowed to check the EC checkbox for any subsequent resubmission.

The “Appeal” function should be used only if the establishment disagrees with a specific modification or reason for rejection. The creation of an appeal is not a means to “resubmit” a returned application. For example, if an LPDS reviewer returns a label application because the label image is not legible, the Submitter should not appeal this decision, but should instead resubmit the label application with an updated, legible label image. See Tip 5 posted in the Announcements. LSAS provides a means for the submitter to appeal LAPs via the “Create Appeal” action in the Available Actions drop-down on the Manage Application screen. This action is discussed in complete detail in the Create Appeal section on page 71. For additional guidance, see the instruction page for Form 8822-4 in Appendix C on page 172.

In such cases, the Agent may use LSAS’s Import XML process to quickly create label applications in LSAS without having to enter the information manually on the multiple input screens discussed in Chapter 7 -Submit a Label Application. The XML Import process is particularly useful when the establishment has an internal electronic data repository from which the raw data for a label application can be pulled and then inserted into an XML file. Once the XML file has been prepared, the Agent can initiate the import process which will read the XML file to automatically create an electronic label application in LSAS. Download the Schema In order to create the XML file, the Agent must first obtain the schema which specifies the required format for the XML data fields and values. The schema is an .xsd file that is available for download within LSAS. 1. Select Import Applications from the Label Applications menu in the left panel.

Click the Download Schema link. 4. You will be prompted to open or save the schema file. Select Save (or Save As) and save the file to your local machine. September 09, 2019 145 Chapter 13 – Import an Application via XML Format', 'Label Submission and Approval System (LSAS) Industry User Guide Create XML Import File from XSD Schema In order for the import to succeed, the XML data must be in a valid format accepted by LSAS. Refer to the next section, LSAS XML Import Guidelines for Industry Users, for complete details on the requirements for the values that must be included in the XML file for the import process to be successful. When the label data in the XML file is formatted per the LSAS schema, the agent can import the XML into LSAS to create a label application that can be submitted to LPDS for review and adjudication. Note: If the Agent utilizes a separate software application for handling label applications, he must configure the in-house system to export label information using the XML schema so that it is readable by LSAS. Recommended XSD-to-XML Conversion Tool: Multiple sites online offer free XSD-to-XML conversion tools. Different sites will generate differently-formatted XML files. The conversion tool at the following site has been tested and verified to generate the XML file in a format that is accepted by LSAS. Online XSD to XML generator XSD2XML website*: http://xsd2xml.com/ Note: This conversion tool will only create the raw XML file in the appropriate format for LSAS; it does not enter the actual values required in the label application. You will need to edit this auto-generated XML file to include the label application data. *USDA-FSIS has no affiliation with this site and does not guarantee the site’s performance or availability. September 09, 2019 146 Chapter 13 – Import an Application via XML Format', 'Label Submission and Approval System (LSAS) Industry User Guide LSAS XML Import Guidelines for Industry Users Default String Value for Text Fields The default string value in the generated XML file will vary depending on how you convert the XSD schema to XML. For example, if you use the online tool from http://xsd2xml.com, then the default string in the XML file might be ""str1234"" while a different tool, located at https://devutilsonline.com/xsd-xml/generate-xml-from-xsd, might set all default string values to ""string"". This document will generally indicate ""str1234"" as the default XML string value. Please be aware that your particular XML file may have a different default string value, and adjust your steps accordingly. Required Fields If the field description in this document indicates that a field value is required on the LSAS Web UI, but not required in the XML Import file, then you have the option of entering a value in the XML file or waiting to enter it via the UI. (LSAS will not prevent you from uploading the XML file if you did not enter a value for the field in the XML file.) If you did not enter a value for a field in the XML file, then, after importing the XML file, you must enter a value for it via the LSAS Web UI. LSAS will not allow you to save or submit the application via the UI until you have entered a value. Special Characters In most cases, if you need to enter a special character into one of the text fields in the XML file, you can do so without having to add any special formatting in the XML file. However, there are five characters that require special formatting in the XML file in order for the import process to complete successfully. For these five characters, you can choose either of the methods shown in the table below (entity replacement or numeric replacement). Original Character XML Entity Replacement XML Numeric Replacement < (less than operator) &lt; &#60; > (greater than operator) &gt; &#62; “ (double quotes) &quot; &#34; & (ampersand) &amp; &#38; ‘ (apostrophe / single quotation mark) &apos; &#39; September 09, 2019 147 Chapter 13 – Import an Application via XML Format', 'I I I I I I I I I Label Submission and Approval System (LSAS) Industry User Guide Field Descriptions – All Fields in the XML Import File XSD File Field Order XML Import File Field Name & Guidelines 1 NameOfProduct Required in XML file?

When should I utilize this function? If a submitter does not yet have an establishment number for an establishment he is associating to a label application, then LSAS can generate a temporary establishment number until the official number is assigned. NOTE: If you know the establishment’s name or number, then you must utilize the “Add Establishment from PHIS” button rather than using the temporary establishment function. This is to keep establishment data consistent in LSAS. LSAS TIP 2 – Label Image Resolution When attaching your Label Image to your submission, we recommend the resolution be set at 300 dpi when scanned and orientation set to portrait.

In some cases, a layer consisting of a clear mask or “varnish” overlays all underlying layers. It is important that this layer be disabled or turned off before uploading the image to LSAS. LSAS TIP 11 -Egg Product Labels and Exotic Species To avoid unnecessary delays, labels for egg products and exotic species are NOT eligible for generic approval and they must be submitted to LPDS for review and approval.
