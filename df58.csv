Washington, D.C. 20250 Dear Importer or Customs Broker: The United States Department of Agriculture\'s (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (PSIS) is the public health regulatory agency responsible for ensuring that domestic and imported meat, poultry, and processed egg products are safe, wholesome, and correctly labeled and packaged, based on the statutory authority ofthe Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA); the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA); and the Egg Products Inspection Act (EPIA). All shipments of meat, poultry, and egg products exported to the United States, which are certified by the foreign country\'s competent authority, must be presented for reinspection at an PSIS official import inspection establishment, or alternative inspection location authorized by PSIS. FSIS has published a final rule that, effective November 18,2014, changed FSIS\' meat, poultry, and egg products import regulations to eliminate the requirement for a paper copy of the import application for import inspection (FSIS Form 9540-1), clarify that the prior notification timeframe for import inspection applications must be submitted when entry is filed with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and change the specific product information that will assist FSIS in designating reinspection assignments and enforcement strategies for shipments that fail to present (FTP) to FSIS for reinspection. Additional clarification for each of these changes is provided below. Public Health Information System (PHIS) Import Component and the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) On February 19,2014, President Obama signed an Executive Order streamlining the import and export process for America\'s businesses. Executive Order 13659 requires the completion and government-wide utilization of the International Trade Data System (ITDS) by December 2016. When fully implemented, ITDS will allow businesses to submit the data required by CBP and its Partner Government Agencies (PGAs) to import or export cargo through the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE), or ""Single Window."" CBP is working to complete and deploy core trade processing capabilities in ACE by December 2016, and as part of this transition, a mandatory time line has been established requiring trade users to begin filing electronic data to ACE. Starting on November 1, 2015, importers or brokers must submit electronic cargo release and entry summary data-including any data within PGAs\' jurisdiction-to CBP through ACE. An Equal Opportunity Provider and Employer', ""The FSIS PHIS import component, which launched in 2012, automates and streamlines the import inspection application processes by electronically linking with CBP's ACE. The current PHIS-ACE interface accommodates a limited amount of data transfer, transmitting the entry and entry summary data collected by CBP. Importers and Customs brokers filing entry with CBP submit the additional PSIS-specific data on the paper import inspection application (FSIS Form 9540-1 ). Ultimately, the Single-Window system will enable U.S. importers and Customs brokers to enter FSIS import inspection application data directly into ACE through the Automated Broker Interface (ABI) as part of the CBP entry process, thereby eliminating the need to file a separate paper application with FSIS. To incorporate the PSIS-specific data elements as part of the PHIS-ACE interface and give importers or brokers the option of submitting import applications electronically, FSIS implemented a PGA Message Set pilot in April2014, initially involving two Customs brokers and three ports of entry. The PGA Message Set populates additional PSIS-specific data elements in the PHIS import component for importers and brokers filing entry with CBP, which expedites data entry and shipment clearance. Since the publication of FSIS' final rule, the PGA Message Set eliminates the need to file a separate paper application (FSIS Form 9540-1) with FSIS. FSIS will expand the pilot to include all ports, as well as all interested importers and brokers by November 2015. FSIS will soon provide information on upcoming stakeholder events that will give importers and brokers an overview of the FSIS PGA Message Set and outline the next steps for the industry. Import Inspection Application and Prior Notification FSIS' meat, poultry, and egg products import regulations require importers to apply for the inspection of imported product. In the final rule, FSIS clarified the timeframe for when applicants must submit import inspection applications; required the import inspection application (FSIS Form 9540-1) for egg products; and required additional information, such as production dates, when a country, foreign establishment, or specific product has been delisted or relisted as eligible for export. This information will help FSIS to verify that the relevant product was produced in the foreign establishment during an eligible timeframe. The final rule clarifies that applicants must submit import inspection applications to FSIS in advance of the shipment's arrival, but no later than when the initial entry is filed with CBP (prior notification). As noted above, the PHIS import component interfaces with CBP's ACE system and has the capability to receive the data needed to complete the import inspection application. Applicants that file their Customs entry with the PGA Message Set will meet the prior notification requirement. Applicants using paper applications must provide the paper application to FSIS in advance of the shipment's arrival at the official import inspection establishment or other PSIS-approved location designated on the import inspection application, and no later than when the entry is made An Equal Opportunity Provider and Employer"", 'with CBP. FSIS inspection program personnel will enter the additional required FSIS data into the PHIS import component by using information from the paper import inspection application. IfFSIS has not received the application prior to the shipment\'s arrival, FSIS will notify the establishment management of the violation and that future shipments that do not meet the prior notification requirement will likely be refused entry. In addition, if the shipment is not rejected and FSIS proceeds with reinspection, the importer may experience delays in the import inspection process as a result of the delayed receipt ofthe application and subsequent data entry into PHIS. Importers and brokers that do not utilize PGA Message Set are to transition from the current FSIS Form 9540-1 to the revised import inspection application (FSIS Form 95401) no later than March 18,2015. The revised FSIS Form 9540-1 (http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/a8eead0d-23c3-428e-937f\xad a8a0Sb09edbb/FSIS~9540-1-Import-lnspection-Application.pdf?MOD=AJPERES) that is completed by the importer or broker must be correct. The revised import inspection application requires the production date(s) when a country, foreign establishment, or specific product has been de listed or relisted as eligible for export. Ifproduct codes are used in place of production dates, these codes must be translated into dates (mm/dd/yyyy) on the inspection certificate. Attachment 1 summarizes the options and requirements to apply for import inspection and Attachment 2 provides information on FSIS product categorization for meat, poultry, and egg products certified for export to the United States. Failure to Present (FTP) Imported meat, poultry, and egg product that has entered commerce without FSIS import reinspection violates the FMIA; the PPIA; or the EPIA, as well as the implementing regulations for each Act (9 CFR 327.6; 381.199; 590.925). The importer ofrecord is responsible for any product identified as FTP and when a product has been identified as a FTP, FSIS will request, through CBP, a redelivery of the shipment and appropriate CBP penalties. As part of the Single Window initiative, FSIS is working with CBP to automate the redelivery process by December 2016, which will streamline enforcement ofCBP redelivery requirements and meet the goals ofExecutive Order 13659. Customs has full authority to assess penalties and liquidated damages claims and to seize merchandise for violations of Customs or other laws enforced by the Customs Service. For more information about CBP redelivery requirements and penalties, please contact CBP\'s Office of Regulations and Rulings (http://www.cbp.gov/contact/intemationaltrade-contacts). FSIS may also request that the importer of record recall FTP product, if the shipment cannot be redelivered. Imported meat, poultry and egg products are considered ""in-commerce"" when they are off-loaded at a location other than the official import inspection establishment or other FSIS approved location designated on the import inspection application. If imported product bypasses FSIS reinspection, FSIS considers such product to be in-commerce and a FTP. The FTP product -whether the shipment is intact or partial -will no longer be eligible for reinspection. Product still in the original shipping containers may either be destroyed or returned to the country of An Equal Opportunity Provider and Employer', ""origin. If any imported product identified as FTP has been removed from the original cartons or further processed, FSIS will initiate a regulatory control action to deal with the product, including any further processed product that contains the FTP product, to ensure appropriate disposition (i.e., destruction). Under this final rule, FSIS will continue to require all shipments ofmeat, poultry, and egg products exported to the United States to be certified by the foreign country's competent authority and presented for reinspection at the designated FSIS official import inspection establishment, or alternative inspection location authorized by FSIS. FSIS also will continue to perform verification activities at the designated official import inspection establishment on these imported products, prior to release into commerce. FSIS intends to work with foreign governments, industry, and all interested stakeholders in implementing these changes. In particular, we believe it is important for importers and brokers to begin adopting and participating in the electronic import processes described in this letter, which will help ensure that FSIS meets the goals and deadlines of Executive Order 13659. We believe this transition to a more electronic environment will benefit industry, FSIS, and most of all, the public health. FSIS strongly encourages importers and brokers to work together closely in meeting FSIS import requirements.

Process Category: There are nine (9) process categories identified in 9CFR 417.2(b). Of the nine (9) listed, Slaughter is considered an internal process that occurs in establishments where the animals or birds are slaughtered. This category is not used for imported products. An additional process category that is not contained in 9CFR 417 .2(b) is Egg Products. Note that FSIS has recently renamed two process categories: Raw Product-Ground and Raw Product-Not Ground are now referred to as Raw Product-Non-Intact and Raw Product-Intact, respectively. However, use of either terminology will be acceptable to FSIS. Note that official foreign inspection certificates should reflect the process category name, rather than the obsolete coding previously used by FSIS (e.g. 03B, 03C, etc.). These codes have been included in the table as some countries previously certified the process categories on the inspection certificates with this coding. Raw Product-Non-Intact: This process category applies to establishments that further process by using processing steps such as grinding, comminuting, injecting product with solutions, or mechanical tenderization by needling, cubing, pounding devices or other means of creating non-intact product. Examples of finished products in this category include raw products reconstructed into formed entrees, mechanically separated species and advanced meat recovery product. If the establishment produces bench trim or pieces of meat produced from non-intact meat, then the bench trim or pieces are also considered non-intact. Raw Product-Intact: FSIS considers raw products to be intact unless they have undergone any of the processes associated with the Raw Product-Non-Intact process category. Thermally Processed -Commercially Sterile: This process category applies to establishments that use a thermal processing step. Thermally processed, commercially sterile finished products are products in cans or flexible containers such as pouches, or semi-rigid, as in lunch bowls. Thermally processed, commercially sterile products are addressed in Subpart G, 318.300-311 for meat food products, and Subpart X, 381.300 to 311, for poultry products. Not Heat Treated-Shelf Stable: This process category applies to establishments that further process by curing, drying, or fermenting processing step as the sole means by which product achieves food safety. Establishments in this process category may apply a low-level heat treatment as long as the heat treatment is not used as means to achieve food safety. The finished products produced under this Process Categories are shelf stable. FSIS does not require shelf stable products to be frozen or refrigerated for food safety purposes. Heat Treated -Shelf Stable: This process category applies to establishments that further process by using a heat treatment processing step to achieve food safety in combination with curing, drying, or fermenting processing step to achieve food safety. The finished products produced under this process category are shelf stable. FSIS does not require shelf stable products to be frozen or refrigerated for food safety purposes. If the establishment produces using the processing steps applicable under this process category and the product is not shelf stable, then establishment is producing product under the process category Fully Cooked-Not Shelf Stable. Fully Cooked-Not Shelf Stable: This process category applies to establishments that further process products by using primarily a full lethality heat process step (e.g. cooking) to achieve food safety. The finished products that establishments produce under this process category are not shelf stable. FSIS requires the products to be frozen or refrigerated for food safety purposes. These products also meet the definition of Ready to Eat (RTE) as defined in 9 CFR 430.1.', ""Heat Treated but Not Fully Cooked-Not Shelf Stable: This process category applies to an establishment that further processes products that are (1) not ready-to-eat products (NRTE) or (2) raw otherwise processed products that are refrigerated or frozen throughout the product's shelf life. Meat and poultry products are produced using a heat process that meets one of the following criteria: a. The heat processing step is not adequate to achieve food safety. Products may be partially cooked or heated to set batter on a raw product. b. The heat processing step applied to meat or poultry component was adequate to achieve food safety, however product is further processed, assembled, or packaged so that cooked meat or poultry products contacts nonready to-eat product ingredients. In this case, the final product is in a form that is not edible without additional preparing to achieve food safety. An example of this product is pot pie product that contains cooked chicken and raw dough. NOTE: This category may also include products that receive a full lethality treatment but there is no standard of identity defining them as fully cooked (e.g., hotdogs or barbecue) or a common or usual name that consumers understand to refer toRTE product (e.g., pates). Products with Secondary Inhibitors-Not Shelf Stable: This process category applies to establishments that further process by using a curing processing step or a processing step using other ingredients that inhibit bacterial growth. These products are generally refrigerated or frozen throughout the product's shelf life. Depending on the process and ingredients, these products may or may not meet the definition ofRTE as defined in 9 CFR 430.1. Eggs/Egg Products: This process category applies to dried, pasteurized and unpasteurized egg products. Product Category (with Applicable Species) The Product Categories are shown in the FSIS Product Categorization table with the appropriate species indicated for each. The Species designations FSIS is using for PHIS are: for Meat: Beef, Veal, Pork, Lamb, Mutton, and Goat; for Poultry: Chicken, Turkey, Duck, Goose, Guinea, and Squab, including for Ratites: Emu, Ostrich, and Rhea; for Eggs: Chicken, Turkey, Duck, Goose and Guinea; and for Egg Products: Chicken, Turkey, Duck, Goose, and Guinea. For each product, the certification must indicate which species is predominant in the product to assure the appropriate regulations are applied to the product when applicable. Product Group. The product group defines the product down to a level that FSIS can program appropriate types of inspections (TOI) for examinations and laboratory sampling. Regulatory references are added where applicable for clarification. While these appear to be self-explanatory, for Raw Product-Intact, Cuts are cuts of meat (e.g., steaks, chops, etc.) that are below the Primal and Subprimallevel."", 'The following table displays the process categories and the types of finished products that can be present in a process category. Finished Product Types by Process Category Process Categories Finished Products Raw Product NRTE Product RTE Products Thermally Processed Product Slaughter • Raw -Non Intact (Raw Ground) • Raw-Intact (Raw Not Ground) • Thermally Processed -Commercially Sterile • Not Heat-Treated-Shelf Stable • • Heat Treated -Shelf Stable • • Fully Cooked-Not Shelf Stable • Heat Treated but Not Fully CookedNot Shelf Stable • Product with Secondary Inhibitors-Not Shelf Stable • • Eggs/Egg Products Not Applicable Ready to Eat applies to any product intended for human consumption without further preparation steps. Note: Products that appear fully cooked or are customarily consumed without further preparation, but the label does not include cooking instructions, are by default considered RTE. RTE fully cooked means that the products have been sufficiently cooked so that they are safe to eat as they are, with no further preparation required by the consumer. Note: Many ofthese products are customarily eaten hot, and heating instructions may be included on the label. Some frozen RTE products require reheating for palatability. These frozen products are still safe to eat without this further preparation by the consumer and are therefore still considered RTE. Some examples include: fully cooked hams, cooked beef, roast beef, pastrami, corned beef, hot dogs, meat loaves, meat and poultry salads, sliced luncheon meats, baked chicken, frozen entrees, and poultry rolls. Fresh or frozen entrees with fully cooked meat or poultry portions combined with fully cooked sauces, vegetables, pasta, or other ingredients are RTE products. These products are designed to be re-heated by the consumer, and may include instructions for re-heating.', 'Not Ready to Eat applies to products with cooking instructions or labeled with statements on the principal display panel such as ""Cook Thoroughly, Cook and Serve, Not Ready to Eat, or For Safety and Quality-follow these cooking instructions."" These products are considered NRTE. Certain NRTE products are required to bear safe handling instructions (SHI). Some NRTE finished products are heat treated but are not fully cooked. These NRTE products should have sufficient labeling information to inform the consumer that the product must be cooked for safety. This information may be contained within the product name on the principal display panel, and may contain cooking instructions that refer to cooking the product for safety rather than heating the product for best quality. The product often times may bear a safe handling instruction. Some NRTE finished products are prepared with both meat/poultry components that have received a lethality treatment in combination with non-meat/poultry components that need to receive a lethality treatment. These multicomponent products, e.g., meals, dinners, and entrees, have labeling features which are conspicuous so that intended users are fully aware that the product must be cooked for safety. The principle display panel on the label defines these products, e.g., ""Cook and Serve, ""Must be thoroughly cooked,"" ""Cook before eating"", and the product should include cooking instructions when required.
