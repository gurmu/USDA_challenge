The HACCP regulations (9 CFR Part 417) require establishments to develop and implement a system of controls designed to address safety hazards reasonably likely to occur in their production process. Therefore, this HACCP model’s focus, and the focus of the other HACCP models, is on product safety, not product quality characteristics. With the rule, FSIS made available a guidebook for the preparation of HACCP plans and a generic model for each food processing category defined in regulation 9 CFR 417.2(b)(1). The guidebook and the generic models have been updated since their initial publication to be consistent with current science and policy. FSIS recommends you use the updated Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans when developing an establishment-specific HACCP plan. Generic models serve as useful examples of how to meet the regulatory requirements. Each model represents a food processing category. Each processing category may contain numerous products. Therefore, each single model represents a category of products and, as such, the models do not demonstrate unique products or novel processes. The generic models are not intended to be used “as is.” FSIS recommends that establishments tailor the model(s) to fit the establishment’s operations. Thermally processed, commercially sterile (TPCS) products are commonly referred to as canned products although the containers can be metal cans, glass jars, flexible pouches, paperboard, and other types of hermetically sealed containers. Processors of TPCS products must identify their biological, physical, and chemical food safety hazards when performing their hazard analysis. Under 9 CFR 417.2(b)(3) of the HACCP regulations, establishments do not have to address the microbiological food safety hazards identified in its hazard analysis if the product is produced in accordance with the requirements of 9 CFR Part 431. However, canning establishments that identify chemical or physical food safety hazards as reasonably likely to occur (RLTO) are to address those hazards in their HACCP plan. The regulations provide that canning establishments do not have to address microbiological hazards in their HACCP plan because FSIS recognized that the canning regulations were based on HACCP concepts and provide for the analysis of thermal processing systems and controls to exclude biological food safety hazards. However, a canning establishment may choose to address the microbiological food safety hazards in its HACCP plan. In either case, the requirements in 9 CFR parts 431 and 417 must be met through the establishment’s HACCP system. This HACCP model illustrates the scenario when the establishment does not address microbiological hazards in a HACCP plan and does not identify chemical or physical food safety hazards as reasonably likely to occur. Thus, this model does not include any critical control points (CCP). This model does contain the required product description, list of product ingredients and materials, flowchart, and hazard analysis. The model may not necessarily apply to all operations or products. Products or operations may require CCPs depending on the operation. The flow diagram demonstrates a general production process and should be modified to reflect the processes used at the establishment. The records produced while documenting a HACCP plan, including all documentation used to support the hazard analysis, are HACCP records (9 CFR 417.5(a)). Ensure you maintain the documents produced while developing a HACCP plan. For further assistance with developing HACCP plans see the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans and the guidance materials available on the FSIS HACCP webpage.', 'Page 2 of 15 EXAMPLE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION1 Thermally Processed, Commercially Sterile: Beef Stew Process or Product name Beef Stew Important product characteristics (Aw, pH, Preservatives, etc.) None Intended use2 Ready-to-eat; typically heated before consumption.

The FSIS Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans and the generic HACCP models are intended for small and very small establishments seeking assistance in understanding the requirements in Title 9 Code of Federal Regulations (9 CFR) Part 417. The HACCP model is for demonstration purposes only. The model does not represent requirements that must be met. Establishments are required to develop HACCP plans specific to their facilities, production practices, and products. 2 The intended use or consumer of the product must be identified in accordance with 9 CFR 417.2(a)(2). Identifying the product’s intended use in the product description is one way to meet the regulatory requirements specific to 417.2(a)(2). 3 Each establishment’s products may have their own defined shelf life. Thermally Processed, Commercially Sterile products must be shelf stable per 9 CFR 431.1. 4 At-risk populations include young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised persons.', 'Page 3 of 15 EXAMPLE LIST OF PRODUCT INGREDIENTS AND INCOMING MATERIAL5 Thermally Processed, Commercially Sterile: Beef Stew Meat and meat by-products Frozen beef Non-meat food ingredients Water, Frozen diced celery, Frozen sliced carrots, Frozen tomato puree, Modified food starch, Textured soy protein, Spice mix, Salt, Sugar.

FSIS determines the suitability of the use of food ingredients used in the production of meat, poultry, and egg products. FSIS consults, as necessary, with FDA on the requirements under the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations. See FSIS Directive 7120.1, Safe and Suitable Ingredients Used in Meat Poultry and Egg Products for the list of suitable ingredients. 7 Establishments will follow different process schedules developed by a processing authority for the product packaged in different container sizes.', 'Page 4 of 15 EXAMPLE PROCESS FLOW DIAGRAM8 Thermally Processed, Commercially Sterile: Beef Stew 18.

However, if an establishment implements different critical operational parameters in the process from the scientific support, or the scientific support identified does not contain microbiological data, then the establishment should collect in-plant data demonstrating the critical operational parameters that it has implemented can all be met AND should collect in-plant microbiological validation data or identify scientific support with microbiological data that demonstrates the effectiveness of those implemented critical operational parameter (FSIS Compliance Guideline HACCP Systems Validation, page 27).', 'Potential Hazard RLTO Justification or Basis Controls CCP Page 11 of 15 plastic from contaminating the product. 8.

C: None P: None DATE: APPROVED BY: i Scientific references are important in making decisions, providing justifications, and validating the HACCP system. When scientific references are used for decisions, the referenced articles must be part of the HACCP records. If the scientific justification is from FSIS, then list the document name. If justification is not from an FSIS program, then HACCP system design must be supported by documentary evidence – that is, the theoretical principles, expert advice from processing authorities, scientific or technical data, peer-reviewed journal articles, pathogen modeling programs, or other information demonstrating that particular process control measures can adequately prevent, reduce, or eliminate specific hazards. These non-FSIS supporting documents must be kept for the life of the HACCP plan. ii Because the results obtained under prerequisite programs could affect decisions made in the hazard analysis, an establishment is required to maintain records associated with these programs as supporting documentation for its hazard analysis (9 CFR 417.5(a)). When an establishment determines that a potential hazard is not reasonably likely to occur because the implementation of a prerequisite program (e.g., Sanitation SOP, written sanitary dressing procedures incorporated into prerequisite programs, purchase specifications, or antimicrobial interventions) prevents conditions that make the potential hazard likely, that prerequisite program then becomes part of the HACCP system and as a result, must be validated. This means that establishments must maintain scientific or technical support for the design of those prerequisite programs used to support decisions in the hazard analysis and must collect in-plant validation data to support that the programs are implemented as designed (see FSIS Compliance Guideline HACCP Systems Validation, page 5).']"
