text_by_page,"['Extraordinary Circumsances - Procedures for Evaluating Labeling In extraordinary circumstances, that is, when product has been retained (""tagged"") by program personnel at official establishments or when there is some other unforeseeable impediment to movement of meat or poultry product, and a temporary label approval would remove the impediment (refer to "" Information Required For Requesting a Temporary Approval"" and 9 CFR 317.4(f) and 381.132(f) ), an accelerated label evaluation can be requested. A submission that asserts that there are extraordinary circumstances that justify an accelerated label evaluation will need to explain why extraordinary circumstances exist, include the information required by regulations for temporary approvals, and be accompanied by information from the establishment\'s labeling records about prior label approvals. FSIS recommends that a contact at the establishment be identified on the request for an evaluation based on extraordinary circumstances. As part of the label evaluation, LCPS may contact the inspector at the establishment to consult on the request. Requests for an accelerated evaluation because of extraordinary circumstances should be delivered to the Distribution Unit of LCPS and marked to the attention of the Labeling Compliance Team Leader.']"
