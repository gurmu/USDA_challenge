text_by_page,"['HACCP Model for Unpasteurized Liquid Egg (Raw Non-Intact Processing Category) The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) published the Pathogen Reduction/Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) Systems Final Rule (PR/HACCP rule) in July 1996, mandating all USDA inspected meat and poultry establishments implement a HACCP system. Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) is asystematic and scientific method of process control for the production of safe food products. The HACCP regulations (9 CFR Part 417) required meat and poultry establishments to develop and implement asystemof controls designed to improve the safety of their products. The HACCP models’ focus is on product safety, not product quality characteristics. On October 29, 2020, the USDA published a final rule that updated the egg products inspection regulations. The USDA amended the egg products inspection regulations to require official plants that process egg products to develop and implement Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures (Sanitation SOPs) to meet other sanitation requirements consistent with USDA’s meat and poultry regulations (effective date: October 29, 2021) and develop and implement HACCPSystems (effective date: October 31, 2022). With the PR/HACCPrule, FSIS made available aguidebook for the preparation of HACCP plans and a generic model for each food processing category defined in the regulation (9 CFR 417.2(b)(1)). The guidebook and the generic models have been revised since their initial publication to be consistent with current science and policy. FSIS recommends you use the updated Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans when developing an establishment-specific HACCP plan. Generic models serve as useful examples of how to meet the regulatory requirements. Each model represents a food processing category. Each processing category may contain numerous products. Therefore, each single model represents a category of products and, as such, the models do not demonstrate unique products or novel processes. The generic models are not intended to be used as is. Establishments are to tailor the model(s) to fit the establishment’s operation. This generic HACCP model illustrates the Raw Non-Intact processing category with an unpasteurized liquid egg product. The model’s critical control points (CCPs) do not necessarily apply to all egg productsoperations or products. Products or operations may require fewer or more CCPs depending on the operation. The flow diagram demonstrates a general production process and should be modified to reflect the processes used at the establishment. The food safety critical limits selected must come from scientific documents or other reliable sources. This model includes references for guidance on the selection of critical limits. The records produced while documenting a HACCP plan, including all documentation used to support the hazard analysis are HACCP decisionmaking records (9 CFR 417.5(a)). Ensure you maintain the documents produced while developing a HACCP plan. For further assistance with developing HACCP plans, see the Egg Products Hazards and Controls Guide, the FSIS Food Safety Guideline for Egg Products, the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans and the guidance materials available on the FSIS HACCP Guidance webpage. Visit the State HACCP Contacts and Coordinators webpage for a list of contactswho provide technical advice, assistance, resources and conduct activities to support HACCP implementation in small and very small plants.1 1This information is best suited for small and very small establishments seeking assistance in understanding the requirements in Title 9 Code of Federal Regulations (9 CFR)Part 417. TheHACCP model is for demonstration purposes only. The model does not represent requirements that mustbe met.

The list (Directive 7120.1) can be used as supporting documentation for chemical hazard controls (safety and suitability).

However, if an establishment implements different critical operational parameters in the process from the scientificsupport, or the scientificsupport identified does not contain microbiologicaldata, then the establishment should collect in-plant data demonstrating the critical operational parameters that it has implemented can all be met AND should collect in-plant microbiologicaldata or identify scientific support with microbiological data that demonstrates the effectiveness of those implemented critical operational parameter(FSIS Compliance Guideline HACCP Systems Validation, page 27). 10', 'Step Potential Hazard RLTO Justification / Basis Controls CCP temperature combination to minimize pathogen outgrowth (Table 2 – Cooling Operations within FSIS Food Safety Guideline for Egg Products, 9/9/2020) C: None P: None 10.

Biological hazardsarelivingorganisms. Chemical hazardsmaybe naturallyoccurringin foods, used or added during the processingoffoods, or administered to live animals. Physical hazards are acomponent ofafood that is unexpected, such as plastic, glass, metal, or bone in a boneless product. See the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans for more information about hazards identification. ii Place thejustification for your decision in column 4. Control measures for hazards not reasonably likely to occur are entered in column 4. Control measures for hazards reasonably likely to occur are entered in column 5. Ifa hazardis reasonable likely to occur, then a CCP must be addressed atthis step or a later step. See FSISEgg Products Hazards and Controls Guide for a list of frequently used controls. iii Scientific references are important in making decisions, providing justifications, and validating the HACCP system. When scientific references are used for decisions, the referenced article must be part of the HACCP records. Ifthe scientific justification is from FSIS,then list the documentname. If justificationis not from an FSISdocument, then HACCP system design must be supported by documentary evidence –that is,the theoretical principles, expert advice from processing authorities, scientific or technical data, peerreviewed journal articles, pathogen modeling programs, or other information demonstrating that particular process control measures can adequately prevent, reduce, or eliminate specific hazards. These non-FSIS supporting documents must be kept for the life of the HACCP plan. iv Because the results obtained under prerequisite programs could affect decisions made in the hazard analysis, an establishmentis required to maintain records associated with these programs as supporting documentation for its hazard analysis (9 CFR 417.5(a)). When an establishment determines thata potential hazard is not reasonably likely to occur (NRLTO) because the implementation ofa prerequisite program (e.g., Sanitation Standard Operating Procedure (Sanitation SOP), written sanitary dressing proceduresincorporated into prerequisite programs, purchase specifications, antimicrobial interventions) prevents conditions that make the potential hazard likely, that prerequisite program then becomes partof the HACCP systemand as a result,must be validated. This means thatestablishments must maintain scientific or technical support for the design of those prerequisite programs used to support decisions in the hazard analysis and must collect in-plant validation data to support that the programs are implemented as designed (see FSIS Compliance Guideline HACCPSystems Validation). 14']"
