Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) is a systematic and scientific method of process control for the production of safe food products. The HACCP regulations (9 CFR Part 417) require establishments to develop and implement a system of controls designed to improve the safety of their products. The HACCP models’ focus is on product safety, not product quality characteristics. With the rule, FSIS made available a guidebook for the preparation of HACCP plans and a generic model for each food processing category defined in the regulation (9 CFR 417.2(b)(1)). The guidebook and the generic models have been revised since their initial publication to be consistent with current science and policy. FSIS recommends you use the updated Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans when developing an establishment-specific HACCP plan. Generic models serve as useful examples of how to meet the regulatory requirements. Each model represents a food processing category. Each processing category may contain numerous products. Therefore, each single model represents a category of products and, as such, the models do not demonstrate unique products or novel processes. The generic models are not intended to be used “as is”. Establishments are to tailor the model(s) to fit the establishment’s operation. The model’s critical control points (CCPs) do not necessarily apply to all operations or products. Products or operations may require fewer or more CCPs depending on the operation. The flow diagram demonstrates a general production process and should be modified to reflect the processes used at the establishment. The food safety critical limits selected must come from scientific documents or other reliable sources. Each model includes references for guidance on the selection of critical limits. This model illustrates how establishments might include, in the production of ground beef, products from beef intended for intact use and from beef intended for non-intact use. The “sources” here include beef from: 1) in-house slaughter product that underwent antimicrobial interventions and verification testing for STEC (shiga toxin-producing E. coli strains O157, O26, O45, O103, O111, O121 and O145); 2) purchased product intended for non-intact use with a certificate of analysis (COA) for STEC testing; and 3) product purchased without a COA and intended for intact use. The records produced while documenting a HACCP plan, including all documentation used to support the hazard analysis, are HACCP records (CFR 417.5(a)). The selection of processing categories and HACCP models are preliminary steps to completing a hazard analysis. The documents produced during the selection process are HACCP records. Ensure you maintain the documents produced while developing a HACCP plan. For further assistance with developing HACCP plans see the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans and the guidance materials available on the FSIS HACCP webpage.', 'Page 2 of 13 EXAMPLE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION1 Process / Product Name: Raw, Non-Intact Beef Process / Product Name Raw Non-Intact Beef: Ground Beef, Beef Patties, Jalapeno Cheddar Burgers, Tenderized Steaks, and Cubed (tenderized) Steaks.

None DATE: APPROVED BY: 1 Prior to developing the HACCP plan please read the FSIS Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans for detailed descriptions of the worksheets and hazard analysis. The FSIS Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans and the generic HACCP models are intended for small and very small establishments seeking assistance in understanding the requirements in Title 9 Code of Federal Regulations (9 CFR) Part 417. The HACCP models are for demonstration purposes only. The models do not represent requirements that must be met. Establishments are required to develop HACCP plans specific to their facilities, production practices, and products. 2 The intended use or consumer of the product must be identified in accordance with 9 CFR 417.2(a)(2). Identifying the product’s intended use in the product description is one way to meet the regulatory requirements specific to 417.2(a)(2). 3 At-risk populations include young children, the elderly and immunocompromised persons.', 'Page 3 of 13 EXAMPLE LIST OF PRODUCT INGREDIENTS AND INCOMING MATERIAL4 Process / Product Name: Raw, Non-Intact Beef Meat and Meat by-products 1.

To review restrictions on the use of nitrite and sodium ascorbate or sodium erythorbate, see 9 CFR 424.22(b). 5 FSIS and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that establishes the working relationship followed when responding to notifications for the use of food additives (including ingredients) intended for use in the production of FSIS regulated products. FSIS determines the suitability of the use of food ingredients used in the production of meat, poultry, and egg products. FSIS consults, as necessary, with FDA on the requirements under the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations. See FSIS Directive 7120.1, Safe and Suitable Ingredients Used in Meat, Poultry and Egg Products for the list of suitable ingredients. 6There are many different organic acids (for example, lactic acid, acetic acid). Establishments will need to research the various organic acids and select a product best suited for their unique circumstances and validate its effectiveness.', 'Page 4 of 13 EXAMPLE PROCESS FLOW DIAGRAM7 Process / Product Name: Raw, Non-Intact Beef 1a. Meat Receiving: Beef and beef heart meat from inhouse slaughter HACCP plan intended for non-intact use8 7 This is an example flow diagram. Establishments’ flow diagrams for the same product may be different. Establishments determine which steps are included in their process. The steps must represent all relevant hazards in the hazard analysis. 8 The flow diagram and hazard analysis demonstrate the use of three differently sourced beef products. They are from in-house slaughter production (step 1a) that underwent interventions as part of the slaughter HACCP plan, purchased product intended for nonintact use (with COA) (step 1b) and purchased product intended for intact use (without a COA) (step 1c). Note that CCP 1 Organic Acid Application (step 4) is a control measure only for purchased beef intended for intact use and without a COA. Also note the organic acid application occurs before the beef (in step 1c) is ground or subject to other further processing (step 5). Three source types are used to illustrate how establishments might address STEC in incoming materials that have received different interventions and microbial analysis. 1e.

(Yes or No)11 Justification / Basis for Decision12 If yes in Column 3 (hazard RLTO), What Control Measures Can Be Applied to Prevent, Eliminate, or Reduce the Hazard to Acceptable Levels13 Is this Step a Critical Control Point (CCP)? 9 See Meat and Poultry Hazards and Controls Guide for lists of potential biological, physical, and chemical hazards and frequently used controls and preventive measures. 10 Hazards are grouped into three categories: Biological (B), Chemical (C), and Physical (P). Biological hazards are living organisms. Chemical hazards may be naturally occurring in foods, used or added during the processing of foods, or administered to live animals. Physical hazards are a component of a food that is unexpected, such as plastic, glass, metal, or bone in a boneless product. See the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans for more information about hazards identification. 11 Place the justification for your decision in column 4. Include control measures in column 4 for hazards not reasonably likely to occur and place them in column 5 for hazards reasonably likely to occur. If a hazard is reasonable likely to occur, then a CCP must be addressed at this step or a later step. See FSIS Meat and Poultry Hazards and Controls Guide for a list of frequently used controls. 12 Scientific references are important in making decisions, providing justifications, and validating the HACCP system. When scientific references are used for decisions, the referenced article must be part of the HACCP records. If the scientific justification is from FSIS, then list the document name. If justification is not from an FSIS source, then HACCP system design must be supported by documentary evidence – that is, the theoretical principles, expert advice from processing authorities, scientific or technical data, peerreviewed journal articles, pathogen modeling programs, or other information demonstrating that particular process control measures can adequately prevent, reduce, or eliminate specific hazards. These non-FSIS supporting documents must be kept for the life of the HACCP plan. 13 Because the results obtained under prerequisite programs could affect decisions made in the hazard analysis, an establishment is required to maintain records associated with these programs as supporting documentation for its hazard analysis (9 CFR 417.5(a)). When an establishment determines that a potential hazard is not reasonably likely to occur because the implementation of a prerequisite program (e.g., Sanitation SOP, written sanitary dressing procedures incorporated into prerequisite programs, purchase specifications, antimicrobial interventions) prevents conditions that make the potential hazard likely, that prerequisite program then becomes part of the HACCP system and as a result, must be validated. This means that establishments must maintain scientific or technical support for the design of those prerequisite programs used to support decisions in the hazard analysis and must collect in-plant validation data to support that the programs are implemented as designed (see FSIS Compliance Guideline HACCP Systems Validation, page 5).', 'Step Potential Hazard RLTO Justification / Basis Controls CCP Page 6 of 13 1a.
