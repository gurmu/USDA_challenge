FSIS requests that all eligible countries submit their 2019 Microbiological Sampling and Testing Program Plan and 2018 Microbiological Sampling and Testing Program Results. The tables included in this guidance are intended to assist Central Competent Authorities (CCAs) in providing FSIS with the information requested in FSIS’s SelfReporting Tool (SRT) question, Government Microbiological Testing Programs. FSIS is providing suggested reporting table formats for the annual data submissions of the 2019 Microbiological Sampling and Testing Program Plan and 2018 Microbiological Sampling and Testing Program Results that are due to FSIS by May 18, 2019. The use of these reporting table formats is optional; FSIS will review information submitted in other formats that incorporate the necessary information. The information that should be submitted includes: • 2019 Microbiological Sampling and Testing Program Plan (Tables 1 and 2 – suggested reporting format) 1) The types of products or production classes and the types of microbiological analyses that are included in government verification sampling programs for those products or production classes 2) The method/type of sample collection 3) The test portion that is analyzed for each type of sample that is collected 4) The microbiological methodology used to analyze the sample, including the screening method used as part of detection, if applicable 5) Planned frequency of testing for eligible establishments for each of the products or process categories • 2018 Microbiological Sampling and Testing Program Results (Table 3 – suggested reporting format) 1) The actual number of samples analyzed for each product type or production class for each pathogen 2) The established criteria by which the analysis result is evaluated for compliance (e.g., number of allowed positives) 3) Regarding follow-up to unacceptable test results from government testing, submit a list of eligible establishments with unacceptable sampling results, including the number of samples analyzed, the number of unacceptable results, and the CCA’s enforcement strategy in response to unacceptable results. Regarding the 2019 Microbiological Sampling and Testing Program Plan, FSIS is including the attachment, FSIS Government Microbiological Sampling and Testing Program, as a reference. This attachment includes sampling and testing frequencies for FSIS government testing programs.

Table 2: Suggested Reporting Table for the 2019 Government Microbiological Sampling and Testing Program Annual Plan. The data reported each year should include the number of samples planned for analysis for each product type/process category and for each of the different pathogen analyses that are conducted. Additionally, the information should include the number of eligible establishments (by production volume or by volume of products exported to the US) and the total number of samples planned for those establishments in each of those categories.

Alternatively, the CCA may choose to use the volume of products that are exported to the US to categorize establishments eligible to export in order to determine the appropriate frequency for testing. If the frequency of sampling is based on volume of products exported to the US, the corresponding volume ranges would be: Very Small Est (<20,000 lbs./month exported to the US), Small Est (20,001-100,000 lbs./month exported to the US), Medium Est (100,001-5,000,000 lbs./month exported to the US), Large Est (>5,000,000 lbs./month exported to the US).', 'FSIS Guidance on Suggested Reporting Tables for the Government Microbiological Sampling and Testing Program NOTE: This document is updated from the 2018 version but does not contain substantive changes to the suggested reporting format. Table 3: Suggested Reporting Table for the 2018 Government Microbiological Sampling and Testing Program Annual Results. This information can be formatted similarly to the current year’s proposed sampling plan (Table 2) but should include actual sampling numbers for the previous year’s Government Microbiological Sampling and Testing Program. The data reported each year should include the actual number of samples analyzed for each product type/process category and for each of the different pathogen analyses that are conducted. Additionally, the information should include the number of establishments that were sampled, preferably grouped by production volume, or by volume of products exported to the US, and the total number of samples collected and analyzed at each of those establishments in the previous year. If there were positives that exceeded the criteria as outlined in the Government Microbiological Sampling and Testing Program Annual Plan (Table 1), a list of eligible establishments that failed to meet the criteria and a description of the CCA’s enforcement strategy in response to unacceptable results should also be included.
