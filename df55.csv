PURPOSE This compliance guideline would help poultry slaughter establishments train their employees to conduct the carcass and associated viscera sorting activities that are required under the New Poultry Inspection System (NPIS). II. BACKGROUND The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) published a final rule http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/00ffa106-f373-437a-9cf36417f289bfc2/2011-0012F.pdf?MOD=AJPERES; to establish a new inspection system called the NPIS. Under the NPIS establishment personnel are required to sort carcasses and remove unacceptable carcasses and parts before the birds are presented to the FSIS online carcass inspector. FSIS believes that training of establishment sorters is vitally important to ensure that they are able to properly perform their duties under the NPIS. Therefore, FSIS has developed guidance documents to assist establishments in the training of their carcass sorters. This guidance is based on the training that FSIS provides to its online inspection personnel, who are responsible for sorting carcasses under the existing inspection systems. The Agency is posting this guidance material on the FSIS Web site: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/regulatory-compliance/complianceguides-index and announcing the availability of such materials through the FSIS Constituent Update. This Compliance Guideline articulates how establishments can meet FSIS expectations regarding sorting activities under the NPIS. It is important to note that this Guidance represents FSIS’s current thinking on this topic and should be considered useable as of this issuance. Request for Comments: FSIS is seeking comments on this guidance document. All interested persons may submit comments regarding any aspect of this document, including but not limited to: content, readability, applicability, and accessibility. FSIS will update these guidelines in response to any comments that it receives and as needed to reflect the most current information available to FSIS and stakeholders. The comment period will be 60 days. Comments may be submitted by either of the following methods: Federal eRulemaking Portal: This Web site provides the ability to type short comments directly into the comment field on this Web page or attach a file for lengthier comments.

Comments received will be made available for public inspection and posted without change, including any personal information, to http://www.regulations.gov . III. GUIDANCE FOR SORTER TRAINING PROGRAMS A. Training Program Elements This compliance guideline recommends training elements and post-mortem inspection standards that FSIS has found effective in training FSIS online inspectors to identify carcasses and parts exhibiting condemnable conditions that are unwholesome and unfit for human food. Poultry slaughter establishments can use the information in this guideline to train establishment employees that would conduct sorting activities under the NPIS. As stated previously this compliance guideline is based on FSIS training materials for its online inspectors which are available at: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/inspection/workforce-training/regional-onsite-training; These training materials can be a valuable resource for additional details and background, such as providing a module for familiarizing employees with the steps in the slaughter process. Training objectives, workshops and evaluation tests are also provided in the training. Proper training is important to establishment sorters’ ability to make accurate decisions on how to address carcasses exhibiting condemnable conditions. Under the NPIS, if sorters do not make these decisions correctly, FSIS inspection personnel are required to take actions such as stopping the production line to remove contaminated carcasses, issuing non-compliance records, and directing the establishment to reduce the line speed to ensure that the establishment is able to maintain process control, and that the online carcass inspector is able to conduct a carcass by carcass inspection. A single training method or program may not be applicable to all establishments. Individual establishments should design training programs consistent with the operational conditions in the establishment. FSIS recommends that each establishment develop a standardized training program for its sorters to enable them to properly identify and dispose of carcasses and parts exhibiting condemnable conditions to ensure that carcasses and parts are not used as human food. FSIS recommends the following types of training as effective elements of a sorter training program: • Classroom or offline training is a lecture type presentation that provides essential information for sorters to be able to: o recognize and name common parts of poultry carcasses and organs;', '5 o recognize and name common conditions affecting poultry carcasses and viscera; o differentiate among normal, localized, and generalized conditions affecting poultry carcasses and viscera; o determine the disposition of each carcass and viscera and take appropriate actions to ensure removal and disposal of unwholesome and unfit carcasses, parts, or viscera to ensure they can not be used as human food; and o take appropriate recording actions. NOTE: An exam or self-assessment for trainees may be helpful to measure and quantify understanding and comprehension of training. • Wet lab is an offline training activity that provides trainees with practical application of what they have learned in classroom training. Features include: o using real examples of carcasses and parts –both normal and abnormal; o performing hands on practice prior to beginning normal duties online to identify carcass conditions and make dispositions; o acting on carcass disposition made; and o recording actions. • On the job training is to practice what has been learned in lecture including: o performing sorting at production rates; o identifying carcass, parts, and viscera dispositions; o receiving real time feedback from supervisors; and o taking appropriate actions as determined necessary. • Follow up sessions (called correlations) are to reinforce previous learning. Features include: o conducting these sessions at a set regular frequency, o discussing regularly standardized procedures to make decisions to identify and properly dispose of carcasses on a continuous basis at production rates; and o describing reasons for making dispositions and appropriate actions. • Continuous monitoring of individual employee performance to maintain skill level If questions related to dispositions arise establishment management may contact the FSIS public health veterinarian (PHV) or send questions to askFSIS. ( http://askfsis.custhelp.com/; )', '6 B. Carcass Disposition and Sorting Procedures The purpose of carcass sorting is to separate carcasses, parts and viscera that are unwholesome and unfit for human food from those that are fit for human food. When carcasses and parts exhibiting condemnable conditions are identified, they would be properly disposed to ensure they are not used as human food. Through observation and occasional touching of the carcass and viscera, sorters make decisions called dispositions of each carcass, part, or viscera. Dispositions are based on the stage of the disease and to what degree, if any, the bird is recovering from the disease at the time the bird is slaughtered. If a disease process or injury exists in the live bird, the disease will stop progressing at the time of slaughter, but the visible changes (lesions) in the bird caused by the illness or injury will remain. The more severely affected a bird is, the more likely the whole carcass is unwholesome. Under the NPIS, the establishment sorter would make a decision about the wholesomeness and fitness of each carcass and viscera and properly dispose of unwholesome carcasses, parts and viscera to ensure they are not used as human food. • If the carcass and viscera appear wholesome, they would be allowed to continue down the line to the FSIS carcass inspector located at the end of the line. • If the carcass is wholesome except for localized conditions that can be removed, those portions of the carcass exhibiting condemnable conditions would be removed and disposed of properly. The rest of the carcass is wholesome and would proceed down line to the FSIS online carcass inspector. • Localized conditions means one or more conditions exist in the carcass or viscera, but each condition affects only one particular part and does not relate to the other parts of the carcass or viscera. The localized portions of carcasses, parts, and viscera are unwholesome and unfit and actions may be taken to trim, salvage or reprocess locally affected carcasses either on the line or off the line. The affected tissues that are unwholesome would be removed and disposed of properly as described above. • Generalized conditions include conditions that have affected the carcass to the extent that much of the carcass is affected and cannot be trimmed or salvaged. Carcasses and viscera affected with generalized disease conditions are unwholesome and unfit for human food and should be disposed of properly. (In some cases, the viscera may be saved for human food.) • Generalized conditions also include those conditions that make the entire carcass and viscera unwholesome, and the carcass and viscera must be properly disposed to ensure that they are not used as human food. • Finally, generalized conditions also include disease conditions that produce systemic change in birds. Those carcasses and viscera show certain obvious changes (see section V. A. Septicemia and Toxemia) that affect the whole', '7 carcass. Carcasses showing systemic change may also exhibit a localized condition. In either case any carcasses showing systemic change would require proper disposal of the entire carcass and viscera to ensure they are not used as human food. • If the carcasses exhibit conditions that are questionable and require further review, then the carcasses could be placed on a holding rack for further review by establishment supervisors or team leaders. This compliance guideline includes an appendix to be used as resources to assist establishments in the training of sorters. Appendix: Anatomy of Poultry is provided for establishment sorters to recognize common parts of the poultry carcass, skeleton, and digestive tract. Image Descriptions are provided in the text of this guide to describe the conditions of carcasses and parts shown in each image. The descriptions are under each image and a list of the descriptions is also located at the end of this document. FSIS has found that using standardized procedures and thought processes result in effective and accurate sorting on a continuous basis. A single sorting procedure or thought process may not be applicable to all establishments. FSIS recommends that sorters on a moving line use standardized procedures to enable them to make accurate dispositions on a continuous basis. IV. NORMAL CARCASSES, PARTS, AND VISCERA A. General Features Knowing how normal carcasses, parts, and viscera appear is necessary to accurately identify carcasses, parts, or viscera that are abnormal. Diseases and other abnormalities produce visible changes to poultry carcasses. Poultry carcasses that are normal can look different from each other because of their age, breed, diet and the slaughter practices of the establishment. Normal young chickens and turkeys will have healthy skin, firm muscles, and fat in the flaps, the gizzard and around the heart. There may be some slight color changes to the skin of the drumstick and thigh and sometimes in the fat inside their bodies. The best way to learn what is normal is to look at birds under the direction of establishment supervisors or lead team members. Normal carcasses, parts, and viscera are not affected with disease or other conditions. If the carcass is wholesome and normal without any localized or generalized disease or other conditions, it would be allowed to continue down the line to the FSIS online carcass inspector. The following images show normal carcasses.', '8 10-1822 This is a well-nourished young chicken with ample body fat and no obvious blemishes. The body is plump.

The surface is shiny. 09-0794 This normal bone marrow from a young turkey appears uniformly red with a fine texture. V. GENERALIZED CONDITIONS REQUIRING WHOLE BIRD DISPOSAL A. Septicemia/Toxemia Septicemia/toxemia (Sep/Tox) is caused by disease-producing bacteria and their toxins in the blood which produce systemic change in the bird. Systemic change affects the body as a whole, rather than localized portions of it. The systemic changes found in Sep/Tox are the result of the bird’s organ systems not working properly. Cells weaken allowing blood to leak out of vessels (hemorrhage) into the viscera organs (liver, spleen, kidneys) and muscles of the bird. Other changes cause drying out (dehydration) of the skin and muscle wasting. Sep/Tox carcasses are usually dark in color with dark reddish viscera, especially the gizzard and heart fat. Other fat may also have an abnormal color ranging from pale to brownish red. The kidneys, liver, and spleen may appear swollen. Inside the cavity of the carcass small amounts of fluid mixed with blood may be found. In both eviscerated (opened to remove the guts) and non-eviscerated carcasses, the skin and muscle will appear dark or blue and have a dried appearance (dehydrated). The carcasses may also show muscle breakdown or wasting which gives a shrunken appearance especially to the breast muscles. The keel bone may be seen sticking out from beneath the skin of the breast muscles. If a carcass shows systemic change (Sep/Tox), as described above, it is unwholesome and must be disposed of properly to ensure the carcass and its viscera are not used as human food. However, not every carcass affected with Sep/Tox will show all of these signs.', '14 If carcasses are affected with any other condition or disease and also shows signs of systemic change (Sep/tox), the carcass and its viscera must be disposed of properly to ensure they are not used as human food. What to Look For: • carcass appears dark red, pale, or blue in color; • severe drying out of the skin and muscle may be observed; • liver, kidneys, and spleen are swollen and congested (filled up) with blood; • carcass has generalized muscle wasting. Do not dispose of carcasses if: • only dark skin or meat is observed, and the rest of the carcass is normal; • the birds are only small birds and have good fat color and healthy looking skin and meat (flesh); and • the carcass appears only slightly dehydrated (the skin looks a little dry). 10-1901 This young chicken evidences adequate body fat and normal skin. The uniformly dark muscle tissue is suggestive of an extreme loss of body fluids, which is consistent with a generalized disease condition. 04-0536 This young chicken evidences necrosis and hemorrhage in the liver and spleen. The liver appears reddish-brown. The general outline is a smooth, unbroken curve. The linear white areas are soft and suggestive of dead tissue. The dark red areas in the liver and dark purple spleen are characteristic of hemorrhage. The parallel orientation of the white and dark red tissue in the liver is 07-0564 This young chicken evidences hemorrhage in the heart. The general outline is a smooth, unbroken curve except where the arteries and veins attach. The dark red surface blotches are characteristic with hemorrhage, which is consistent with a generalized disease condition.', '15 suggestive of swelling caused by the liver pressing against the ribs. Necrosis and hemorrhage are consistent with a generalized disease condition. 10-2017 This young chicken evidences necrosis in the liver. The liver appears red. A significant portion of the liver is pink. Exudates are visible on the surface. The general outline is a smooth, unbroken curve. Necrosis with exudates is consistent with a generalized disease condition. The yellow color of the fat is due to yellow plant pigments in the feed. 09-0625 This young turkey evidences necrosis in the liver. The liver appears red. The general outline is a smooth, unbroken curve. The linear white areas are soft and suggestive of dead tissue. The parallel orientation of the white tissue is suggestive of swelling caused by the liver pressing against the ribs. Necrosis is consistent with a generalized disease condition. 09-0921 This young chicken evidences necrosis in the liver and hemorrhage in the spleen. The liver is soft with white blotches suggestive of dead tissue. The general outline is a smooth, unbroken curve. The dark purple and soft spleen is characteristic of hemorrhage. The heart appears normal. Necrosis and hemorrhage are consistent with a generalized disease condition.', '16 07-0851 This young chicken evidences adequate body fat and normal skin. The enlarged joint at the end of the drumstick is suggestive of inflammation. The uniformly dark muscle tissue is suggestive of extreme loss of body fluids. Inflammation with loss of body fluids are compatible with wasting, which is a generalized disease condition. 10-1950 This young chicken evidences inadequate body fat and normal skin. The prominent keel bone and uniformly dark muscle tissue are compatible with wasting, which is consistent with a generalized disease condition. 10-1257 This young turkey evidences inadequate body fat and normal skin. The prominent thighbone and uniformly dark muscle tissue are compatible with wasting, which is consistent with a generalized disease condition. 10-1352 This young turkey evidences inadequate body fat and normal skin. The linear, red blemishes in the skin are veins filled with blood. The prominent thighbone and uniformly dark muscle tissue 10-0866 The fat attached to the gizzard of this young turkey appears thin, pink, and transparent. This is compatible with wasting, which is a generalized disease 10-0706 The heart of this young turkey appears wet, and offwhite. The fat, normally visible where the arteries and veins attach, is gone. The general outline is no longer a smooth, unbroken curve.', '17 are compatible with wasting, which is consistent with a generalized disease condition. condition. This is compatible with wasting, which is a generalized disease condition. B. Cadaver A cadaver is a generalized condition that causes the carcass and viscera to be unwholesome and unfit for human food. Cadavers are any birds that did not bleed out properly due to a poor or missed cut of the neck veins before the bird entered the scalder. The heat of the scalder causes blood left in the carcass to expand into the skin blood vessels, giving the skin of the carcass and neck a cherry red to purple color. The blood also accumulates in the dependent (lower) regions, such as the necks, wings, and upper breast area. Some cadavers may appear red all over; others will appear red only in the lower regions of the carcass. The blood vessels in the viscera will appear enlarged and the liver may appear burgundy colored. The entire carcass and viscera of cadavers are unwholesome and must be disposed of properly to ensure that they are not used as human food. What to Look For: • cherry red to purple color of whole carcass or the lower regions of the carcass; • sometimes, just the neck will appear cherry red or purple color; • may be no cut on the neck, or may be only partially cut; and • blood vessels in the viscera may appear engorged (filled up with blood). NOTE: Free blood found in the body cavity and on the viscera (not inside the blood vessels) may be caused by improper stunning. Those carcasses are not cadavers. A thorough examination of the carcass may be necessary to make this determination. 05-0899 These are two adequately 10-1568 This is an adequately 03-0715 The skin over the neck on', '18 fleshed young chickens with ample body fat, normal skin, and minimal blemishes. The carcass on the right has normal skin color. The skin over the breast, thigh, and drumstick on the carcass on the left is dark red. The red skin discoloration of the otherwise normal carcass is consistent with a bird that was still breathing when it entered the scald tank. fleshed young turkey with ample body fat and normal skin. The skin over the entire carcass is dark red. The red skin discoloration of the otherwise normal carcass is consistent with a bird that was still breathing when it entered the scald tank. this young chicken is dark red. A visible cut across the cervical vessels is absent. The red skin discoloration and absence of a cervical cut are consistent with a cadaver - a bird that was still breathing when it entered the scald tank. Cadavers are unfit for human food. C. Dead on Arrival (DOA) DOAs are birds that have died by means other than slaughter and are not allowed to be brought into the establishment. However, if DOAs are mistakenly hung on the line, they are to be removed as quickly as possible from the slaughter or evisceration line. Dead on arrival carcasses will have red to purple color and will be cool or cold to the touch. Also, the bird may have a floppy neck. The carcasses may also feel stiff and may have a foul (bad smelling) odor. DOAs are unwholesome and to be disposed of properly to ensure they are not used as human food. What to Look For: • red to purple color; • cool or cold to the touch; • may have a floppy neck; • feel stiff; or • may smell bad. 06-0298 This is an adequately fleshed', '19 young chicken with ample body fat, normal skin, and minimal blemishes. The overall dark appearance evidences dehydration. The prominent dark red discoloration of one side of the carcass is suggestive of blood setting in the carcass. Depending on the ambient temperature and time since death, the carcass might be cool and/or stiff. The overall condition is consistent with a bird that was dead on arrival. D. Leukosis Leukosis is a tumor-causing (neoplastic) viral infection of young chickens. The tumors are seldom seen now because of the vaccination of all birds. The tumors are often small, round, well-defined white to tan nodules in the liver, spleen, or kidney. In the liver or other organs the tumors may appear as white specks. When the skin is affected, the tumors appear in the feather follicle as bumps that are round, small, and whitish to light yellow in color. Leukosis can appear in just the viscera or just in the skin of the carcass; but any carcass affected with only one (or more) of the leukosis tumors in the skin or the viscera are unwholesome; both the carcass and its viscera must be disposed of properly to ensure they are not used as human food. What to Look For: • One or more tumors in the visceral organs or the skin. • Tumors appear white to tan, small, round, and well-defined. • Carcasses with one or more of these tumors are unwholesome, and the entire carcass and viscera must be disposed of properly as described above.', '20 09-0910 This young chicken has round, white nodules, with smooth borders, throughout the liver and spleen. The heart appears normal. Such nodules are compatible with the avian leukosis complex, which is a generalized tumor condition requiring disposal of carcass and viscera. 09-0904 This young chicken has round, white nodules, with smooth borders, throughout the liver and spleen.

VI. LOCALIZED DISEASE OR OTHER CONDITIONS AFFECTING POULTRY CARCASSES A. Contamination During slaughter operations, visible fecal material from the digestive tract is the main way that disease-causing bacteria can be spread to the portions of the carcass that are edible (fit to be eaten by humans). Bacteria that can cause human illness are found in the digestive tract and on the skin of birds when the birds come to slaughter. To prevent fecal material from spreading to edible portions of the carcasses, special care must be taken during handling and sanitary dressing procedures. For these reasons FSIS inspectors enforce a zero tolerance standard for visible fecal material on carcasses before the chiller. FSIS also requires that the establishment put into place effective sanitary dressing procedures throughout its slaughter process to prevent contamination of carcasses and parts. Carcasses that are accidentally contaminated with fecal (or digestive tract) material during slaughter can be reconditioned, if they are reprocessed in a sanitary manner to remove all visible contamination by either online or offline reprocessing procedures. Note: Carcasses that are excessively contaminated are unwholesome and must be disposed of properly to ensure they are not used as human food. What to Look For: • Feces identification o Color is yellow to green, brown or white, o semi-solid to a paste in consistency, and o may or may not have plant material. • Ingesta identification o Color varies with the diet, o Solid or granular consistency and sometimes has digestive fluids and o Identifiable plant material.', '22 10-0174 Digestive tract content is present on the exposed muscle tissue of a young chicken. Digestive tract contents that require removal from carcass and viscera 10-0192 Digestive tract content is present on the skin and exposed muscle tissue of a young chicken. Digestive tract contents that require removal from carcass and viscera 10-0399 Feces is present on the skin of a young chicken. Color is green, has a semi-solid to paste consistency and does not have plant material. Feces requires removal from carcass and viscera.', '23 B. Keratoacanthoma and Other Tumors Keratoacanthoma and other tumors is referring to tumors other than the leukosis tumors that were previously discussed. The most common tumor in young chickens is a keratoacanthoma, which is a tumor of the skin that looks like a miniature crater or ulcer. This tumor can range from one small tumor to many large tumors that overlap or join together (coalesce). If the carcass has so many of these tumors that they coalesce, then the entire carcass and its viscera are unwholesome and must be disposed of properly to ensure they are not used as human food. If there are only a few, smaller tumors, then the tumors can be trimmed and disposed of properly as described above. After the tumors are trimmed, the rest of the carcass can proceed down the line to the FSIS online inspector. What to Look For: • Single tumors or several small tumors that are localized and can be trimmed; • Many tumors that are intermediate to large in size and coalesce are unwholesome, and the carcass are unwholesome and must be disposed of properly as described above. 10-1080 This is an adequately fleshed young chicken. Several round, crater-shaped masses extend throughout the skin. Such masses are compatible with localized tumors and require trimming. 09-0879 This is an adequately fleshed young chicken with coalescing, multiple, round, crater-shaped masses extending throughout the skin. Coalescing tumors reguire disposal of the entire carcass. There are many other types of tumors that occur occasionally in young poultry. If one tumor is very large in size and disrupts normal body functions, for example, taking up too much space in the body then the entire carcass and viscera are unwholesome and must be disposed of properly to ensure they are not used as human food. If there is', '24 more than one tumor of the same kind, which indicates that the tumor has spread (metastasized) then the carcass and its viscera are unwholesome and must be disposed of properly. Localized tumors can be trimmed (if just on the carcass) or all of viscera disposed of properly (if just on the viscera). What to Look For: • If one very large tumor or more than one tumor of the same type, then dispose of carcass and viscera properly to ensure they are not used as human food. • If the tumor is not very large and has not spread then trim tumor if on the carcass, or dispose of viscera only if located on the viscera. 05-1045 This is an adequately fleshed young chicken with a solitary mass extending out from the skin. Such a mass is compatible with a localized tumor and requires trimming. 09-0579 This is an adequately fleshed young chicken. Multiple, round, white masses extend out of the skin. Such masses are compatible with localized tumors and require trimming. 10-1100 This is a well-fleshed young chicken. Multiple, black masses are present in the skin. Such masses are compatible with localized tumors and require trimming. 09-0275 03-0681 10-0151', '25 This is an adequately fleshed young chicken. A round, white mass extends out of the kidney.

A round, red mass compatible with a localized tumor extends out of the kidney and requires trimming. This is a well-fleshed young chicken. A single, firm mass is present under the skin of the thigh. Such a mass is compatible with a localized tumor and requires trimming. 09-0842 Multiple masses filled with blood are visible in the liver of this young chicken. A large ruptured mass is visible in the center of the liver. Such masses are compatible with localized tumors and require trimming. 10-1039 This is a well-fleshed young chicken. A solitary mass is present in the skin. Such a mass is compatible with a localized tumor and requires trimming. 10-0923 Multiple black masses are visible in the liver and lung of this young chicken. Such masses are compatible with localized tumors and requires trimming. C. Airsacculitis In addition to lungs, birds have balloon-like “air sacs” throughout the inside of their chest and belly (abdomen). (See Figure 2. In the Appendix.) The air sacs move the air in and out allowing the bird to breathe. When the carcasses are opened to pull out the viscera, the air sacs are torn apart, so they do not appear as balloons when being sorted. There are 6 pairs of air sacs in chickens and 5 pairs in turkeys. Normal air sacs appear very clear with thin membranes or linings. Normal air sacs are not very noticeable. Airsacculitis is an inflammation of the air sacs that occurs when the bird is fighting off a respiratory tract infection or disease. The signs of inflammation that can be observed are a red color, swelling, and increased production of fluid. In the early (acute) stages of the disease, the air sacs can have a slight, cloudy appearance with a small amount of watery fluid, and only the air sacs are affected. If the disease has been going on for awhile (chronic), then the air sacs may appear thickened and have large amounts of', '26 thick, white to cream-color fluid (exudate). The fluid may also have a cheesy- pus-like appearance. Other organs, such as the liver, lungs, and heart may also show these signs. In carcasses affected with airsacculitis, all of the diseased tissues and fluids may be removed either by online or by offline salvage (vacuum or cut-up) procedures. The kidneys also must be removed and disposed of properly. If disease has spread from the air sacs to the bones of the shoulder joint, all affected tissues must be removed and disposed. After removal of affected tissues online or offline, the carcasses can go down the line to the FSIS online carcass inspector. Carcasses with airsacculitis and signs of systemic change (Sep/Tox) are to be disposed of properly to ensure they are not used as human food. Additionally, carcasses that are extensively affected with air sac such that the inner surfaces of the carcass cannot be observed or the carcass cannot be salvaged are to be disposed of properly as described above. What to Look For: • If a carcass has early stages of airsacculitis with slightly cloudy air sacs and a small amount of fluid, then the affected tissues and kidneys should be removed. • If a carcass has thickened air sacs: large amounts of white to cream-colored fluid; or dry, yellow, cheesy pus, and the visceral organs are affected, then the affected tissues, viscera, and kidneys should be removed. • If airsacculitis has spread from the air sacs to the bones in the shoulder joint, then the affected tissues must be removed and disposed of properly. • If carcasses have airsacculitis and signs of systemic change (Sep/Tox) then the entire carcass and viscera are unwholesome and must be removed for proper disposal. • If carcasses are extensively affected with airsacculitis such that the inside of the carcass cannot be observed, or the carcass cannot be salvaged, then the entire carcass and viscera must be disposed of properly as described above. , 10-1052 10-1051 10-1054', '27 The thoracic air sac of this young chicken contains exudates, which evidence inflammation of the air sac and adjacent tissue. Inflamed tissue is unfit for human food. The abdominal air sac of this young chicken contains exudates, which evidence inflammation of the air sac and adjacent tissue. Inflamed tissue is unfit for human food. The abdominal air sac and sac around the heart of this young chicken contain exudates, which evidence inflammation. The general outline of the liver is not a smooth, unbroken curve, which is suggestive of fibrosis.

Inflamed tissue is unfit for human food. 10-1074 The abdominal air sac of this young chicken contains exudates, which evidence inflammation of the air sac and adjacent tissue. Inflamed tissue is unfit for human food. D. Inflammatory Process Inflammatory Process (IP) is a term to describe inflammation in or under the skin caused by bacteria. Most often the bacteria enter through breaks in the skin caused by birds pecking one another. Usually IP appears as yellow, scabbed areas between the skin and the underlying tissues. IP may also appear as a yellow cheesy material or dried brownish flakes under the skin. In severe cases the skin will have a burnt waffle appearance. IP can occur anywhere on the bird but is most often seen around the vent, abdominal fat flaps, or side of the bird. These localized areas of infection generally can be trimmed to remove affected tissues. IP can also spread under the skin to breast muscles, and for this reason, these carcasses should be thoroughly examined to ensure that all affected portions are removed. If most of the carcass is affected by IP, then the entire carcass and viscera are unwholesome and must be disposed of properly to ensure they are not used as human food.', '28 If the carcass affected with IP also has signs of systemic change (Sep/Tox), then the entire carcass and viscera are unwholesome and must be disposed of properly as described above. What to Look For: • Localized IP: look for areas of yellow, cheesy material found in the vent area, side of the carcass, or abdominal flaps. These areas must be trimmed to remove the unwholesome tissues. • Generalized IP: if the areas of yellow, cheesy material has travelled down to the breast, and most of the carcass is affected or the carcass shows signs of systemic change, then the entire carcass and viscera must be disposed of properly as described above. 06-0305 This is a well-nourished young chicken with ample body fat and no obvious blemishes. A well-defined area across the back is dark yellow to brown. Such a discoloration is compatible with inflammation. Tissue affected by inflammation is unfit for human food. 06-0338 This is a well-nourished young chicken with ample body fat and no obvious blemishes.

Exudates evidence inflammation and inflamed tissue is unfit for human food.', '29 10-1544 This is an adequately fleshed young turkey with quality defects – surface blemishes. Feather follicles appear uniform in size and arranged in rows with approximately equal space between follicles. The scabs and open sores with red margins are consistent with inflammation 10-1502 The skin of this young turkey over the drumstick appears thick, wet, and yellow. The appearance of the skin is consistent with exudates and inflammation. 10-1490 This is a well-nourished young turkey with ample body fat and no obvious blemishes. The majority of the skin appears uniform in color, moist, and thick. Feather follicles appear uniform in size and arranged in rows with approximately equal space between follicles. The thick, wet, yellow appearance of the skin over the breast is consistent with exudates and inflammation. E. Turkey Osteomyelitis Complex Turkey Osteomyelitis Complex (TOC) affects the cartilage of bones and surrounding tissues and joints. The cause is unknown. Any bone may have TOC, but most often the knee, shoulder or hip joints are affected. The swollen joints and soft tissues may be affected mildly or more severely. A green fringed liver may indicate TOC or some other condition. Additionally, carcasses affected with TOC may not have a green liver. For each flock, special examinations are conducted by cutting into the joints to determine whether the flock is affected with TOC. If the flock is affected with TOC, then sorters should identify the carcasses and viscera with swollen joints or green livers for the establishment to perform additional procedures to remove the unwholesome tissue. All affected tissues must be removed from TOC carcasses. If it is not possible to do so, or if the carcass is showing signs of systemic change (Sep/Tox), the entire carcass and associated viscera are to be disposed of properly to ensure they are not used as human food.', '30 What to Look For: • Green fringed livers or swollen joints, especially the knee, hip, or shoulder, may indicate TOC, but it also may indicate other conditions. Carcasses are to be identified for further examination. • Enlarged livers, soft livers with smooth surfaces, or green streaked livers may all be signs of TOC. • Carcasses with green livers or swollen joints and with signs of systemic change are unwholesome and the carcasses and viscera must be disposed of properly. 03-0739 The bone marrow cavity of this young turkey appears white with an open area of tan fluid. This appearance is suggestive of necrosis and exudates, which is consistent with inflammation. 10-2234 This fibrotic liver in a young turkey contains excess bile. The liver appears purple with white spots and blotches. The general outline is not a smooth, unbroken curve. The texture of a fibrotic liver is firm. The fibrosis and excess bile does make the liver unfit for human food. 10-2256 This fibrotic liver in a young turkey contains excess bile. The liver appears purple with white spots and blotches. The general outline is not a smooth, unbroken curve. The texture of a fibrotic liver is firm. The fibrosis and excess bile does make the liver unfit for human food. The fat attached to the gizzard appears thin, pink, and transparent, which is suggestive of a wasting condition. F. Synovitis Synovitis is inflammation of the tissues around a joint. The hock joint is most often affected. Synovitis is caused by either physical injury or infection. The joints appear swollen and may have a red or yellow appearance and contain extra visible fluid. The fluid can range from a clear watery fluid to a severe pus-like fluid that is yellowish in', '31 color and creamy or flaky. The tendons may also be swollen. The affected legs are unwholesome and must be removed from the carcass and disposed of properly. A carcass with synovitis is wholesome unless it also shows systemic changes. If there is no systemic change, then all affected synovial tissues should be removed. 03-0893 The soft tissue around the joint in this young chicken is swollen. The skin appears wet and yellow. This appearance is suggestive of inflammation in the tendons and skin. 09-0811 The drumstick from this young turkey has a prominent swelling under the skin. Such swelling is consistent with the presence of exudates in the underlying tendons. Inflamed tissue is unfit for human food. 10-1203 A prominent greenish swelling is visible next to the kidney in this young chicken. The swelling and discoloration are consistent with the presence of exudates in the hip joint. Inflamed tissue is unfit for human food. 10-1342 The upper drumstick from this young turkey is normal. The lower drumstick has a 10-1383 This is an adequately nourished young turkey with minimal quality defects – retained cuticle and surface', '32 prominent swelling of the joint and the skin is thick and yellow. Such swelling and discoloration is consistent with the presence of exudates in the underlying tendons and skin. Inflamed tissue is unfit for human food. blemishes. A prominent swelling is visible over the thighbone. Such swelling is consistent with the presence of exudates in the underlying tendons. Inflamed tissue is unfit for human food. G. Mutilation Mutilated means the carcass is torn apart shredded or damaged by the slaughter processing equipment. Any part or organ that is mutilated and can be trimmed from the carcass is unwholesome and must be disposed of properly to ensure that it is not used as human food. If the entire carcass is affected, then the carcass is unwholesome and would be disposed of properly as described above. The viscera is wholesome and could be saved for edible product. What to Look For: • If the entire carcass is affected, then it is unwholesome and must be disposed properly as described above; but the viscera is wholesome. • If part of the carcass is affected, then the affected tissues are unwholesome and must be trimmed and disposed of properly as described above. 10-0127 The skin and muscle tissue on this young turkey is mutilated. Mutilated tissue is contaminated and unfit for 10-1254 The muscle tissue on this young turkey is mutilated. Mutilated tissue is contaminated and unfit for', '33 human food. human food. H. Overscald Often overscald carcasses are found after the picking line breaks down, and the carcasses are held in the scalding tank too long. When both the top breast muscle and deep breast muscle have a cooked, white, dry texture, the carcasses are unwholesome and unfit for human food and should be disposed of properly along with its associated viscera to ensure they are not used as human food. Sometimes only the top layer of breast muscle appears white. This hard scald will likely show whitening only of the top layer of breast muscle. The hard scalded carcasses should not be disposed for overscald but should be trimmed to remove any affected tissue, and the viscera if it appears to be cooked. What to Look For: • If both top and deep breast muscles are white and appear cooked: then dispose properly as described above of the entire carcass and viscera. • If only the top layer of breast muscle is whitened: it may be trimmed. I. Ascites Ascites is an abnormal condition that is caused by the heart being overworked. As a result a clear to amber colored fluid collects inside the bird’s body cavity (chest and abdomen). The fluid may also be found in the sac around the heart and the liver may appear swollen. It occurs in young chickens because of growing very fast. The fluid in the body of the carcass should be removed if the inside of the cavity cannot be viewed. If the carcass shows only signs of ascites, then the viscera is unwholesome and must be disposed of properly. The carcass can go down the line to the FSIS online inspector. If the carcass shows signs of ascites and systemic change (Sep/Tox) or any other disease condition, the entire carcass and viscera are unwholesome and must be disposed of properly to ensure the carcass and viscera are not used as human food.', '34 10-1862 A clear, watery fluid is visible in the body cavity of young chicken. Such fluid retention is compatible with ascites. 03-0869 Normal kidneys in a young chicken with blood tinged gelatinous fluid in the body cavity. Such fluid is compatible with ascites. 10-0977 A clear, watery fluid is visible inside the capsule surrounding the heart of young chicken. Such fluid retention is compatible with ascites. J. Breast Atrophy This condition has several names, including green atrophy, green breast, and green muscle degeneration. Atrophy means “wasting away or to decrease in size."" The deep breast muscle on either one or both sides of the keel bone is affected. The condition is found mostly in broad breasted hen turkeys older than five months. The breast (on one or both sides) will appear wasted away as if it has shrunken away from the keel bone. The change in the muscle could look like a small depression or dip, or it could look very extreme or obvious. The deep muscle will be greenish in color, and it will feel hard with a wood-like texture. The breast muscle is unwholesome and must be removed and disposed of properly. K. Turkey Leg Edema Turkey Leg Edema occurs mostly in heavy hen turkeys (older than 25 weeks) from August to October. The thigh may appear very white. The thigh will feel slick on the outside, and gas bubbles may be felt under the skin. Turkey leg edema is an inflammation of the leg. The affected leg is unwholesome and is to be disposed of properly. If there are signs of systemic change in the carcass, then the carcass and viscera are unwholesome and must be disposed of properly to ensure they are not used as human food. L. Bruises A bruise comes from physical trauma or damage to blood vessels and the leakage of blood into the surrounding tissue. The color of a bruise varies from red to green to', '35 black depending on the age of the bruise. Bruises that affect most or all of the whole carcass or carcasses showing signs of systemic change are unwholesome and must be disposed of properly. If bruises are localized, they may be removed by trimming. NOTE: If sorters find increased numbers or clusters of severely bruised carcasses at the sorting station, this finding may be an indication that there has been a breakdown in the establishment’s good commercial practices. Appropriate establishment personnel should be notified of the findings. 10-0210 This is a well-nourished young chicken with ample body fat and minimal blemishes.

Tissue affected by a bruise is unfit for human food. M. Parts Disposition Generally, when carcasses are affected with localized disease or other conditions, the affected carcass, part or viscera is unwholesome and must be disposed of properly to ensure that they are not used as human food. If the unwholesome portions or parts can be effectively removed, the remainder of the carcass is wholesome. The following are some examples of some organs or parts that are unwholesome and must be removed and disposed of properly, but the rest of carcass is wholesome. Dispose properly to ensure the livers with the following unwholesome conditions are not to be used as human food: • Fatty degeneration: Have visible, well defined light spots. (Livers with a uniform yellowish color throughout the liver are the result of diet and are wholesome.) • Scar tissue due to disease (cirrhosis) • Extensive small hemorrhages • Inflammation (redness, swelling) • Abscess • Contamination from bile • Green or other discoloration • Granuloma • One Leukosis tumor (also dispose of carcass and all viscera) • One non-leukosis tumor • Areas of necrosis (cells are dead because of death or injury)', '37 03-0673 This normal liver in a young chicken contains excess fat.

Kidneys are unwholesome and unfit and must be removed when: • from carcasses affected with airsacculitis in the abdominal area; • the liver is unwholesome because of disease; • the viscera is unwholesome; or • the kidneys are swollen. 09-0491 The kidneys in this young chicken are uniformly enlarged and pale in color. The uniform enlargement and color change are compatible with a growth disturbance and significant fibrosis. Tissue affected by disturbances of growth and significant fibrosis are unfit for human food. Salpingitis: the oviduct tubes are swollen and filled with firm cheesy fluid (normally the tubes are not seen, but when infected they are visible). All affected tissues are', '40 unwholesome and must be removed and disposed of properly.

Outside Anatomy shows the parts of a chicken carcass after the feathers are removed and before the carcass is opened to remove the viscera (guts). The comb and wattles are on the head of poultry and are largely for looks. They vary in size and color based on type and breed, and whether they are females or males. Snoods and whiskers (beards) are external structures only found in turkeys.', '43 Feathers cover almost the entire surface of the bird. They grow from follicles, which are organized into groups or zones and are called feather tracts (see shaded areas of Figure 1. The skin of chickens is thinner and more delicate than that of animals. In addition, the color of the skin depends on the type or breed of poultry, age, and diet. The skin may also be affected by the scalders used to loosen feathers. The neck attaches the head to the body. The wings are the “arms” of the bird. The thigh is the upper leg and the drumstick is the lower leg. Meat from both of them is commonly called “dark meat.” The breast (“white meat”) is located in the front of the bird and contains large muscles. The hock joint is between the lower leg and the paw. The paws are the feet of the bird. The preen or oil gland is an important gland and is located near the tip of the tail. When poultry are preening, they take oil from this gland and apply it to their feathers. Inside (Internal) Anatomy The trachea or windpipe is the structure that carries air into the bird. Air passes through the trachea and into the air sacs. These structures are very thin, colorless membranes that when filled with air look like tiny balloons inside the body. The air sacs come in pairs, and the number of pairs is 5 in chickens and 4 in turkeys. The air sacs are round sacs that also have tiny finger like projections that go into certain bones and are shown in Figure 2. Air Sacs.', '44 The digestive tract of the bird are shown in Figure 3. Digestive Tract of Fowl. The digestive tract of the chicken begins with the mouth or beak, which does not contain lips or teeth. The mouth is connected to the esophagus, also called the goozle or gullet, which connects with the Crop (or craw) where feed is stored. After the crop is the stomach of birds. This stomach is called the true stomach (or proventriculus) and digests proteins. Next is the gizzard or the ventriculus. Its function is to grind the food. Often in healthy birds, there are large amounts of fat around the gizzard. The small and then large intestines come next and end at the cloaca. The cloaca opens to outside of the bird in an area called the vent. There is also a small sac on the side of the cloaca', '45 called the rosebud. The rosebud is seen when the equipment cutting around the vent accidentally cuts into it. Birds that are healthy and well nourished usually have large amounts of fat throughout their tissues. The areas storing the fat are the abdominal or belly area, the vent flaps, and the gizzard and the heart. The normal liver has two lobes and each lobe is drained by a bile duct. One duct is larger and makes the gall bladder. The color of the liver depends on the fat content or bile content. Poultry do not contain a urinary bladder, but they do have two kidneys, one on each side and are set into the back bone of the bird. Ureters carry urinary waste from the kidneys to the cloaca where it leaves the bird. Bones: The bones of chickens are shown in Figure 4. Skeleton of domestic fowl.', '46 The vertebral column (spine) is made up of many small bones and is divided into several parts: the neck, chest, lower back or pelvic and the tail. The neck has a bone called a wishbone or pulley bone. The bone has two branches and an air sac lies between the two branches. The shoulder blade is a bone that lies on top of each side of the rib cage. The shoulder blade with a bone from the wings and the coracoid bone makes up the shoulder joint. There are several bones in the wing. The bones at the very end of the wing are called the wing tip, and it is often broken during the slaughter process. The knee joint is made of the thigh bone and the drumstick. The upper leg of the chicken is the thigh bone just as in animals. The drumstick is the lower leg, again just as in animals. The next bone down from the drumstick is the shank bone. The hock joint is formed from the drumstick and the shank. The hock joint is normally opened up for sorting. The shank joins the paws (or toes). The keel or breast bone is a single large bone on the bottom surface of the bird.', '47 Image Descriptions 03-0667: This inflamed liver in a young chicken contains small granuloma throughout. The liver appears tan with spots and blotches. The general outline is a smooth, unbroken curve. The texture of an inflamed liver is soft to firm. The granuloma make the liver unfit for human food. 03-0673: This normal liver in a young chicken contains excess fat. The liver appears tan with spots and blotches. The general outline is a smooth, unbroken curve. The texture of a fatty liver is soft. The excess fat does not make the liver unsafe or unfit for human food. 03-0679: The connective tissue below the skin of this young chicken contains localized exudates. The skin appears normal. Exudates evidence inflammation and inflamed tissue is unfit for human food. 03-0681: This is an adequately nourished young chicken with a quality defect – retained lung. A round, red mass compatible with a localized tumor extends out of the kidney and requires trimming. 03-0715: The skin over the neck on this young chicken is dark red. A visible cut across the cervical vessels is absent. The red skin discoloration and absence of a cervical cut are consistent with a cadaver - a bird that was still breathing when it entered the scald tank. Cadavers are unfit for human food. 03-0732: This normal heart in a young turkey appears red with uniformly white fat where the arteries and veins attach. The surface exhibits spots and blotches. The general outline is a smooth, unbroken curve except where the arteries and veins attach. 03-0739: The bone marrow cavity of this young turkey appears white with an open area of tan fluid. This appearance is suggestive of necrosis and exudates, which is consistent with inflammation. 03-0869: Normal kidneys in a young chicken with blood tinged gelatinous fluid in the body cavity. Such fluid is compatible with ascites. 03-0893: The soft tissue around the joint in this young chicken is swollen. The skin appears wet and yellow. This appearance is suggestive of inflammation in the tendons and skin. 04-0536: This young chicken evidences necrosis and hemorrhage in the liver and spleen. The liver appears reddish-brown. The general outline is a smooth, unbroken curve. The linear white areas are soft and suggestive of dead tissue. The dark red areas in the liver and dark purple spleen are characteristic of hemorrhage. The parallel orientation of the white and dark red tissue in the liver is suggestive of swelling caused by the liver pressing against the ribs. Necrosis and hemorrhage are consistent with a generalized disease condition. 05-0899: These are two adequately fleshed young chickens with ample body fat, normal skin, and minimal blemishes. The carcass on the right has normal skin color. The skin over the breast, thigh, and drumstick on the carcass on the left is dark red. The red skin discoloration of the otherwise normal carcass is consistent with a bird that was still breathing when it entered the scald tank. 05-1045: This is an adequately fleshed young chicken with a solitary mass extending out from the skin.
