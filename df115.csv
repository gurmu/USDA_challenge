The HACCP regulations (9 CFR Part 417) require establishments to develop and implement a system of controls designed to address safety hazards reasonably likely to occur in their production process. Therefore, this HACCP model’s focus, and the focus of the other HACCP models, is on product safety, not product quality characteristics. With the rule, FSIS made available a Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans and a generic model for each food processing category defined in the regulation (9 CFR 417.2(b)(1)). The guidebook and the generic models have been updated since their initial publication to be consistent with current science and policy. FSIS recommends you use the updated Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans when developing an establishment-specific HACCP plan. Generic models serve as useful examples of how to meet the regulatory requirements. Each model represents a food processing category. Each processing category may contain numerous products. Therefore, each single model represents a category of products and, as such, the models do not demonstrate unique products or novel processes. The generic models are not intended to be used “as is”. FSIS recommends that establishments tailor the model(s) to fit the establishment’s operation. This generic model uses bacon to illustrate the Heat-Treated, Not Fully Cooked processing category. Bacon is a cured and smoked pork product. Bacon is made with salt as a curing agent. Nitrite is the other most frequently used additive. Bacon may also contain sugars, wood smoke, flavorings, and spices. Bacon receives a heat processing step but the application of heat is not adequate to achieve food safety. Therefore, bacon is not ready-to-eat, it must be kept refrigerated or frozen, and it is cooked before consumption. This model’s critical control point (CCP) does not necessarily apply to all operations or bacon products. HACCP plans may require more CCPs depending on the product and the operation. The flow diagram demonstrates a general production process and should be modified to reflect the processes used at the establishment. The food safety critical limits selected must come from scientific documents or other reliable sources to meet regulatory validation requirements. This model includes references for guidance on the selection of critical limits. The selection of this processing category and bacon HACCP model are preliminary steps to completing a hazard analysis. The records produced while documenting a HACCP plan, including all documentation used to support the hazard analysis are HACCP records ((CFR 417.5(a)). Ensure you maintain the documents produced while developing a HACCP plan. For further assistance with developing HACCP plans see the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP plans and the guidance materials available on the FSIS HACCP webpage.', 'Page 2 of 14 EXAMPLE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION1 Product Name and Process Type: Bacon (Heat-Treated, Not Fully Cooked) Product Name and Process Type Bacon; Heat-Treated, Not Fully Cooked Important product characteristics (Aw, pH, Preservatives, etc.) Contains Sodium Nitrite (120 ppm)2 How it is to be used3 Intended for cooking Packaging (durability and storage conditions) Vacuum packaged Shelf life and at what temperature4 1 month at 40ºF or less or 6 months frozen at 0ºF Where it will be sold (specify intended consumers, especially at-risk populations)5 Sold to household consumers through retail outlets or distributed to hotels, restaurants, and institutions (HRI).

The FSIS Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans and the generic HACCP models are intended for small and very small establishments seeking assistance in understanding the requirements in Title 9 Code of Federal Regulations (9 CFR) Part 417. The HACCP models are for demonstration purposes only. The models do not represent requirements that must be met. Establishments are required to develop HACCP plans specific to their facilities, production practices, and products. 2 Pumped bacon has a regulatory requirement for 120 ppm ingoing Sodium Nitrite or an equivalent amount of potassium nitrite (148 ppm ingoing) and 550 ppm Sodium Ascorbate or Sodium Erythorbate (9 CFR 424.22(b)). 3 The intended use or consumer of the product must be identified in accordance with 9 CFR 417.2(a)(2). Identifying the product’s intended use in the product description is one way to meet the regulatory requirements specific to 417.2(a)(2). 4 Each establishment may have their own defined shelf life. 5 At-risk populations include young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised persons.', 'Page 3 of 14 EXAMPLE LIST OF PRODUCT INGREDIENTS AND INCOMING MATERIAL6 Product Name and Process Type: Bacon (Heat-Treated, Not Fully Cooked) Meat and Meat by-products Pork belly Non-Meat food ingredients Sugar, Salt, Flavor and Spice mixture Antimicrobial interventions7 and processing aids Sodium Nitrite Packaging material Plastic vacuum bags Restricted ingredients and allergens Sodium Nitrite, Sodium Erythorbate Other None DATE: APPROVED BY: 6 List all meat, non-meat ingredients, restricted ingredients (for example, nitrites), processing aids, packaging material used in production of this product. This is important to help identify any special ingredients or processes to address in the HACCP plan.

To review restrictions on the use of nitrite and sodium ascorbate or sodium erythorbate, see 9 CFR 424.22(b). 7 FSIS and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that establishes the working relationship followed when responding to notifications for the use of food additives (including ingredients) intended for use in the production of FSIS regulated products. FSIS determines the suitability of the use of food ingredients used in the production of meat, poultry, and egg products. FSIS consults, as necessary, with FDA on the requirements under the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations. See FSIS Directive 7120.1, Safe and Suitable Ingredients Used in Meat Poultry and Egg Products for the list of suitable ingredients.', 'Page 4 of 14 EXAMPLE PROCESS FLOW DIAGRAM8 Product Name and Process Type: Bacon (Heat Treated, Not Fully Cooked) 12.

Biological hazards are living organisms. Chemical hazards may be naturally occurring in foods, used, or added during the processing of foods, or administered to live animals. Physical hazards are a component of a food that is unexpected, such as plastic, glass, metal, or bone in a boneless product. See the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans for more information about hazards identification. 12 Place the justification for your decision in column 4. Include control measures in column 4 for hazards not reasonably likely to occur and place them in column 5 for hazards reasonably likely to occur. If a hazard is reasonable likely to occur, then a CCP must be addressed at this step or a later step. See FSIS Meat and Poultry Hazards and Controls Guide for a list of frequently used controls. 13 Scientific references are important in making decisions, providing justifications, and validating the HACCP system. When scientific references are used for decisions, the referenced article must be part of the HACCP records. If the scientific justification is from FSIS, then list the document name. If justification is not from an FSIS program, then HACCP system design must be supported by documentary evidence – that is, the theoretical principles, expert advice from processing authorities, scientific or technical data, peerreviewed journal articles, pathogen modeling programs, or other information demonstrating that particular process control measures can adequately prevent, reduce, or eliminate specific hazards. These non-FSIS supporting documents must be kept for the life of the HACCP plan. 14 Because the results obtained under prerequisite programs could affect decisions made in the hazard analysis, an establishment is required to maintain records associated with these programs as supporting documentation for its hazard analysis (9 CFR 417.5(a)). When an establishment determines that a potential hazard is not reasonably likely to occur because the implementation of a prerequisite program (e.g., Sanitation SOP, written sanitary dressing procedures incorporated into prerequisite programs, purchase specifications, antimicrobial interventions) prevents conditions that make the potential hazard likely, that prerequisite program then becomes part of the HACCP system and as a result, must be validated. This means that establishments must maintain scientific or technical support for the design of those prerequisite programs used to support decisions in the hazard analysis and must collect in-plant validation data to support that the programs are implemented as designed (see FSIS Compliance Guideline HACCP Systems Validation, page 5). 15 To determine a CCP, see the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans for a decision tree to evaluate the areas of control (column 5) to determine the best CCP to control, reduce, or eliminate a hazard.

Pork Receiving (fresh) B: Salmonella No It is well documented that raw pork may be contaminated with pathogens.

The name of the program (for example, Receiving Trim SOP) must be listed, and the program and plant data become part of recordkeeping. These programs must have a description of controls and on-going verification used to prevent hazards from occurring. 18 FSIS recognizes the author’s work since it was presented at a public hearing on a proposed regulation.

Injecting Pork Belly B: Pathogen outgrowth No Duration of this step (Injecting Pork Belly) is short enough that pathogen outgrowth is not reasonably likely to occur. According to Tompkin, R.B. 1996, Salmonella growth is limited to < 1-log if product temperatures are no more than 70°F for up to 9 hours. This would be longer than a shift, so outgrowth is not reasonably likely to occur. Bacon (like other forms of not ready-to-eat pork products, including all forms of fresh pork) is customarily well-cooked in the home or elsewhere before being served to the consumer and the product bears safe handling instructions.

P: Metal from injector needles No Written SOP for equipment inspection during operations. No history of findings from daily equipment preoperational inspections (covered in Sanitation', 'Step Potential Hazard RLTO Justification / Basis Controls CCP Page 10 of 14 20 Note: this “historical data” must be supported with evidence from the establishment through the establishment’s history or validation data. When historical data is not available (for example, a HACCP plan for a new process or product), then system design must be supported by other documentary evidence, such as the FSIS Meat and Poultry Hazards and Controls Guide which states “appropriate screening procedure for monitoring equipment” is a frequently used control for foreign material hazards in processing. 21 See FSIS Salmonella Compliance Guidelines for Small and Very Small Meat and Poultry Establishments that Produce Ready-to-Eat (RTE) Products and Revised Appendix A for information that small and very small establishments can use to produce safe products with respect to Salmonella and other pathogens. 22 If an establishment implements a process consistent with the process specifications described in the scientific support, and the scientific support contains microbiological data specifying the level of pathogen reduction achieved by the intervention strategy for the target pathogen identified in the hazard analysis, the in-plant validation data collected during the 90 day initial validation period will consist of data on quantifiable characteristics of the critical operational parameters, such as pressure, temperature, and concentration.

Hanging B: Pathogen outgrowth Duration of this step (Hanging) is short enough that outgrowth is not reasonably likely to occur.

The list contains the allowable amounts and the intended use of the approved antimicrobials that can be used as supporting documentation for chemical hazard controls (safety and suitability). Directive 7120.1 cannot be used as support for the control of biological hazards because the antimicrobial concentration needed to control bacteria is different from the concentrations required for safety and suitability. 25 Taormina, P.J. and Bartholomew, G.W. 2005 Validation of Bacon processing Conditions to Verify Control of Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus.
