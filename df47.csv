A recall is a voluntary action conducted by a firm to remove adulterated or misbranded meat and poultry products from commerce. Although it is your company’s decision to recall a product, the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), the public health regulatory agency within the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), coordinates with you to ensure that you have properly identified and removed recalled product from commerce by verifying the effectiveness of your recall activities. FSIS also notifies the public about product recalls. There are three levels of meat and poultry recalls categorized by FSIS. The type of recall depends upon the potential risk to consumers. ◊ Class I. There is a reasonable probability that eating the product will cause serious, adverse health consequences or death. Examples of a Class I recall include the presence of pathogens in ready-to-eat meat or poultry products or the presence of E. coli O157:H7 and other shiga-toxin producing E. coli O157:H7 or non-O157 STEC in raw ground beef. ◊ Class II. There is a remote probability of adverse health consequences if the product is eaten. Examples of a Class II recall include the presence of very small amounts of undeclared allergens typically associated with milder human reactions, e.g., wheat or soy, or small-sized, non-sharp-edged foreign material in a meat or poultry product. ◊ Class III. Eating the product will not cause adverse health consequences. An example of a Class III recall is the presence of undeclared ingredients, such as excess water in meat or poultry products. U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service', 'Small Plant News Guidebook Series INTRODUCTION A recall may be an alternative to FSIS detaining or seizing adulterated or misbranded products. However, if firms do not adequately remove a recalled product from commerce, a recall does not prevent FSIS from taking other appropriate actions, such as issuing public health alerts or detaining or seizing product to protect the public. The agency will also assess whether your recall strategy, or execution of that strategy, is effective. If it finds it is ineffective, FSIS may seek to bring an enforcement action against you or your consignees. FSIS has developed this guidebook and workbook to aid small and very small establishments that produce meat or poultry products in creating their plans for how they will conduct a recall should it become necessary for them to do so. The following information can be used to design and implement an effective recall plan. 6', '7 How to Develop A Recall Plan U.S. Department of Agriculture / Food Safety and Inspection Service Recall Plans Title 9 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 418 (9 CFR 418), requires that official establishments that produce meat and poultry products prepare and maintain written recall plans. Under this regulation, your plan must specify how you will decide whether to conduct a product recall and describe the procedures that you will follow if you decide that a product recall is necessary. In addition, the regulations require that your plan be available to the FSIS inspector for review upon request. FSIS recommends that processed egg products plants also develop and maintain recall plans, although they are not explicitly required to do so by the regulation.', 'How to Develop A Recall Plan Small Plant News Guidebook Series Important Contact Information Recall Team. Your recall plan should contain a list of all your internal and external personnel who will be involved in a product recall. Include their roles and responsibilities, telephone numbers, fax numbers, and e-mail addresses. Be sure to appoint backups for each person. One person should be identified as the “recall coordinator.” This person may use another title, but the idea is to have one person in charge of recalls and recall planning. The recall coordinator will manage, maintain, and make changes to the recall plan as necessary. The recall coordinator should be knowledgeable about every aspect of the firm’s operations, including purchasing, processing, quality assurance, distribution, and consumer complaints. The recall coordinator should be authorized to make decisions in carrying out a recall and should report to top management at regular, specified intervals. FSIS District Office. Your recall plan should include the telephone number of your local FSIS District Office. If you believe, or have reason to believe, that you have shipped adulterated or misbranded meat or poultry product into commerce, you are required to notify your local FSIS District Office within 24 hours. In addition, you must notify your local FSIS District Office if you believe that you have received adulterated or misbranded product, in accordance with 9 CFR 418.3. 8', '9 How to Develop A Recall Plan U.S. Department of Agriculture / Food Safety and Inspection Service Procedures for Determining a Recall Health Hazard Evaluation. Your plan must specify a method for determining how you will decide whether to conduct a recall if your product is adulterated or misbranded and is in commerce. Evaluating the nature and extent of the health risks associated with the product is one method for doing so. If you choose to assess the health hazards, you should take the following into account: ◊ Whether any illness or injuries have already occurred from eating the product; ◊ What hazards target various segments of the population, (e.g., children, the elderly, immune-compromised individuals, etc.), with particular attention paid to those individuals at greatest risk; ◊ How serious is the health hazard to which the at-risk population would be exposed; ◊ How likely is the hazard to occur; and ◊ What would happen if it did. Here are some examples that you may want to consider when developing your recall plan. This list is not all inclusive, but it will help stimulate your thinking. ◊ Undeclared allergen – What health hazards may arise if product shipped from your plant containing an undeclared allergen is consumed? ◊ Consumer complaints – What are the health hazards if you receive a consumer complaint about a foreign material such as glass or metal in the product that has been shipped from your establishment? ◊ Underprocessing – What are the health hazards if you discover that some of the products have been underprocessed? If your plant produces ready-to-eat product and raw product, will the hazards for these be different?', '10 How to Develop A Recall Plan Small Plant News Guidebook Series ◊ Raw non-intact beef tests positive for E. coli O157:H7 or non-O157 STEC (both plant and FSIS test) ◊ Ready-to-eat product tests positive for any pathogen (both plant and FSIS test) Scope of Recall. Your plan should also outline how you will determine the identity and amount of product to be recalled. It will be your responsibility to define when the problem began, when it was resolved, and what products are affected. Clean-up times do not necessarily define the scope of a recall. FSIS suggests that your plan specify how you will determine the amount of product affected by using various scenarios. Scenarios can include: the contamination of a vat of product with a foreign object, the use of an incorrect label, or the use of the same source of raw materials in other lots on other days of production. When determining the amount of product affected, consider the following: ◊ Your coding of product; ◊ The pathogen of concern; ◊ The processing and packaging; ◊ The equipment; ◊ The Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) monitoring and verification activities (including microbiological testing) that you perform; ◊ Your Sanitation Standard Operating Procedure (SSOP) records; and ◊ Whether some, or all, of the products controlled by the same or substantially similar HACCP plans have been affected.', '11 How to Develop A Recall Plan U.S. Department of Agriculture / Food Safety and Inspection Service Records. Records are vital in tracing product forwarded to consignees and back to potential suppliers. They include invoices, bills of sale, and shipping documents from each transaction in which product made with meat or poultry is purchased, sold, shipped, received, or handled by your plant in connection with any business subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act or the Poultry Products Inspection Act. HACCP system records may also play a part in this process. Records you should have on hand include: ◊ Records needed to permit positive identification of products produced; ◊ Production records, including records on ingredients that are essential for traceback of products and ingredients of the products. All products need a system of product coding; this coding will facilitate an effective recall. Records of raw materials used in each lot of ground beef are especially important. Both you and public health authorities need to know if the problem is traceable to a supplier (refer to 9 CFR 320 and 9 CFR 381, subpart Q);', '12 How to Develop A Recall Plan Small Plant News Guidebook Series ◊ Distribution records that identify and locate shipped products that are recalled. These records should include at least the names and addresses of consignees, shipment method, date of shipment, and the amount of product shipped to each consignee. It is also useful to note which consignees are hospitals, restaurants, distributors, part of a chain, or independent retailers. Here’s a practical example. If a recall of product is necessary because of contamination with Listeria monocytogenes, then a key factor in limiting the scope of the recall is whether the establishment (or retail store) is properly cleaning the equipment between lots. If not, there could be microbial contamination from one lot to another. Carefully maintained production records serve a vital public health purpose by giving the establishment and agency a means of pinpointing potential sources of contamination and providing greater accuracy in determining which products may be affected. Records that help product traceback: ◊ Production or grinding logs showing the times of each grind; ◊ Formulation or blend of raw ingredients, including amounts; ◊ Supplier lot identification; ◊ Finished product lot and sublot identification; and ◊ Any test results associated with either the raw materials or finished product. The records should indicate and track which lots or sublots of a grinding establishment’s ground beef, including rework, and any other raw materials were used. The records should also track the amounts of each that were used.', '13 How to Develop A Recall Plan U.S. Department of Agriculture / Food Safety and Inspection Service Recall Communications Recall Notice. FSIS recommends that your recall plan include an outline of the content of your recall notice. Please see sample recall notices on pages 16-18. When drafting the content of your recall notice, consider the following: ◊ Be brief and to the point; ◊ Clearly identify the product and any other pertinent descriptive information to enable accurate and immediate identification of the product, including: » Product/brand name; » Product code; » Package/case size; » Package/case date code; » Lot number/expiration date; and » Universal Product Code. ◊ Provide an explanation of the risk if the product is eaten; ◊ Concisely explain the reason for the recall and the hazard involved; ◊ Provide specific instructions on what should be done with the recalled products; ◊ Request an official, written response from consignees; ◊ Provide a way for the recipient of the communication to report to the recalling firm whether it has any of the product, e.g., by allowing the recipient to place a collect call to the recalling operation; ◊ The recall communication should not contain irrelevant qualifications, promotional materials, or any other statement that may detract from the message; and ◊ Provide contact information for your firm (for questions). Your plan should also detail how the recall notification will be issued. For example, you can send your recall notice by e-mail, telephone, or', '14 How to Develop A Recall Plan Small Plant News Guidebook Series fax. Written notices should bear a prominent heading to indicate the importance of the communication. For example, a letter might bear a bold red declaration, such as “URGENT FOOD RECALL.” If communication is conducted by telephone, you should document and send a followup letter, e-mail, or fax to ensure that all bases are covered. Public Notification. FSIS recommends that you identify if and how the public will be notified of the recall. Recalls are often announced via a press release through national or local news media, or via a company website. Be sure to include contact information for all potential media, such as television stations, radio stations, and newspapers with local, State, and regional coverage areas, as well as the national wire services. If the actual contacts are not specified, then reference sources of current media contacts for all possible recall scenarios should be specified in the recall plan. The class of the recall and where the product was distributed will determine the type of notification you will use. Generally, distribution levels are categorized as wholesale, retail, hotel/restaurant/institutional (HRI) and consumer users. The more levels affected, the greater the need for different communication methods. At the wholesale level, the product is distributed to a warehouse or distribution center. This is the distribution level between the manufacturer and retailer. The retail level is when the product is received by the retailers for sale to the public. The HRI level is when the product was received by hotels, restaurants, or institutional customers. Lastly, the consumer level is when the product is sold directly to consumers. Regardless of the public notification action you take, FSIS will issue a press release for Class I and Class II recalls. FSIS will issue a Recall Notification Report if the recalled product has only been distributed at the wholesale level (and your firm is able to gain control of the product before it can be further distributed to the retail, HRI, or consumer level) and for Class III recalls. A Recall Notification Report is not distributed to the media.', '15 How to Develop A Recall Plan U.S. Department of Agriculture / Food Safety and Inspection Service Control and Disposition of Returned Product Your recall plan should specify how the recalled product will be controlled pending disposition and disposal. If it will be destroyed after being returned, then notify FSIS prior to destroying the product in the event witnessing the product destruction is necessary. Recall Simulations The best way to test the effectiveness of your recall plan is to conduct a recall simulation that will help you identify any glitches in your recall plan. For example, you might find that a key fax or telephone number of a distributor or supplier has changed. Simulating a recall will keep your recall personnel alert and will familiarize everyone with recall procedures. A simulation will determine how quickly your company can identify and control a lot of affected product. If problems are identified during a recall simulation, then the recall plan should be revised and corrected. Simulations are necessary, and your recall plan will falter without them. If you follow these guidelines, then you and your establishment should be ready in the event of a recall. Having a plan, familiarizing everyone with it, and implementing its procedures will keep you in control. Sample Recall Notices and Notification Letter and Worksheets. On pages 16-19, you will find sample Recall Notices and a Notification letter. You may use these as templates when designing your own Recall Notices and Notification Letters. On pages 20-24, you will find recall worksheets. You may use these for collecting pertinent information during a recall. In addition, a Recall Plan Workbook has been added to help you create a recall plan. The workbook can be found on pages 25-48.

It will take into account the following factors: • Has adulterated or misbranded product been produced? • Has adulterated or misbranded product been shipped? • Where has the product been shipped? • Is the product in commerce? • Is the product available to consumers? 28', '29 U.S. Department of Agriculture / Food Safety and Inspection Service A Sample Recall Plan: The Workbook Scope of Recall Fuerschlinger’s Better Meat Company will assess the amount and type of product that is implicated in a recall. When the problem involves contamination with microbial pathogens, the recall should include all products produced under a single Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) plan between performance of complete cleaning and sanitizing procedures. However, the act of sanitation does not necessarily define the scope of all product removal actions. For instance, with E. coli O157:H7, the company will also consider the use of source materials. Some examples of how to define the scope of product removal actions include: • Contamination of a vat of product with a foreign material; • Use of an incorrect label; or • Use of the same source of raw materials, in other lots, on other days of production. In addition, the Fuerschlinger’s Better Meat Company will consider such factors as: • Coding of product; • Pathogen of concern; • Processing and packaging; • Equipment; • Our HACCP plan monitoring and verification activities (including microbiological testing); • Our Sanitation Standard Operating Procedure (SSOP) records; and • Whether some or all of the products controlled by the same or substantially similar HACCP plans have been affected. The plan will specify how the company will determine the scope of the implicated product for various scenarios and contingencies.', 'Small Plant News Guidebook Series Small Plant News Guidebook Series A Sample Recall Plan: The Workbook Records Company records are maintained in our office at 123 Brown Rd., Springfield, OH 12345. They are kept for a period of time that exceeds the shelf-life and expected use of our products and in accordance with FSIS regulations 9 CFR 320 and 9 CFR 381.175, and contain the following information: • Positive identification of products; • Distribution records (e.g., bills of sale, invoices, shipping papers, etc.); and • Production records that facilitate traceback of products and product ingredients. All of our records include the names and addresses of consignees, shipment methods, and dates of shipment. In addition, we maintain records of all of our suppliers of ground beef (e.g., names and lot numbers of suppliers, and production dates) in accordance with FSIS Directive 10,010.1. 30', '31 U.S. Department of Agriculture / Food Safety and Inspection Service A Sample Recall Plan: The Workbook Depth of Recall The Fuerschlinger’s Better Meat Company Recall Committee has developed a number of scenarios to determine the depth of the recall. Since they are proprietary designs, they are maintained in our office at 123 Brown Rd., Springfield, OH 12345. In the event of a recall, they will be made available to regulatory agencies upon request. The depth of a recall depends on the degree of hazard, the extent of distribution, and the level to which the recalled product was distributed. Levels of recall depth are categorized as: • Wholesale level: Product has been distributed to a warehouse or distribution center where it is not under the direct control of the producing company. • Retail level: Product has been received by retailers for sale to household consumers. • HRI level: Product has been received by hotels, restaurants, and institutional (HRI) customers. • Consumer level: Product has been sold to consumers. Recall Communications We, at Fuerschlinger’s Better Meat Company, consider the health and safety of our employees and the public our highest priority. As such, we have developed various communication methods to inform suppliers, consignees, and consumers about any product recalls we may be involved in. Please see the recall communication templates on pages 38-41. All of our communications will convey the following information: • If the product is subject to recall; • If further distribution or use of any remaining product should cease immediately;', 'Small Plant News Guidebook Series Small Plant News Guidebook Series A Sample Recall Plan: The Workbook • If the direct consignee should, in turn, notify its consignees that received the product about the recall; • Instructions on what to do with the product; and • Our contact information (point of contact and telephone number). Recall Communication Implementation Fuerschlinger’s Better Meat Company will attempt to contact all consignees or customers via the following methods (in this particular order) until a point of contact receives and acknowledges our communication: • Telephone; • E-mail; and • Fax. In addition, all consignees or customers shall be contacted via special delivery letters conspicuously marked (on the letter or envelope) “URGENT – FOOD RECALL.” Follow-up communications shall be sent to consignees or customers who fail to respond to initial recall communications within 24 hours. 32', '33 U.S. Department of Agriculture / Food Safety and Inspection Service A Sample Recall Plan: The Workbook Recall Communication Content All recall communications will be written in accordance with the following guidelines: • Be brief and to the point; • Clearly identify the product and any other pertinent, descriptive information including: o Product/brand name; o Product code; o Package/case size; o Package/case date code; o Lot number/expiration date; and o Universal Product Code (UPC). • Describe the risk involved in consuming the product; • Concisely explain the reason for the recall and the hazard involved; • Provide specific instructions on what should be done with the recalled product; • Request an official, written statement from consignees; • Provide a means for consignees (and other communication recipients) to report whether or not they have any of the product under their control; and • Include our company’s contact information and a point of contact.', 'Small Plant News Guidebook Series Small Plant News Guidebook Series A Sample Recall Plan: The Workbook Responsibility of Recipient Consignees or customers who receive a recall communication should immediately carry out all instructions provided and, where necessary, extend the recall to their consignees or customers. Public Notification The class of a recall and the extent to which the product was distributed in commerce will determine the distribution of public notification by FSIS. Fuerschlinger’s Better Meat Company will decide if the company will issue its own press release in addition to the Recall Release or Recall Notification Report issued by FSIS and how it will be issued. Public notification templates may be found on Pages 38-41. Effectiveness Checks In an effort to assess the progress and effectiveness of a recall, FSIS will conduct effectiveness checks to verify that all consignees (at the determined recall depth) have received notification about the recall and have taken appropriate action. Regardless of the recall scenario, all consignees will be contacted via the following methods (in this particular order) until we receive written acknowledgment from them: • Telephone call; • E-mail or Fax; • Special delivery letters; and • Personal visit. 34', '35 U.S. Department of Agriculture / Food Safety and Inspection Service A Sample Recall Plan: The Workbook Fuerschlinger’s Better Meat Company will consider the following information in regards to the recall effectiveness check process: • How much product is implicated in the recall? • How is the product identified to our customers/retailers (e.g., lot markings)? • How many locations did we ship the product to and where are they? • How did we communicate the product removal action to those who received it? o Did we document this contact? o Did we ask for and receive written acknowledgment from them? • What actions were taken with the product and by whom? • If product was destroyed, then was destruction witnessed and documented? o Were FSIS inspection program personnel present? • Is there a written record of: o When the issue was identified? o When customers were notified? o When we received notification that the product was either placed on hold or was no longer in a customer’s control? • Can we account for most (or all) of the product?', 'Small Plant News Guidebook Series Small Plant News Guidebook Series A Sample Recall Plan: The Workbook Returned Product Control and Disposition Fuerschlinger’s Better Meat Company will specify how the recalled product will be disposed of and how it will be controlled pending disposition. FSIS should be notified prior to disposition actions, which may include destruction or relabeling of product that is returned. If the product is destroyed, it will be rendered inedible for humans and animals. All labeling will be made unusable for trade. 36', '37 U.S. Department of Agriculture / Food Safety and Inspection Service A Sample Recall Plan: The Workbook Recall Simulations Fuerschlinger’s Better Meat Company will conduct biannual simulation exercises to evaluate our recall plan. The simulated recall will involve the selection, without prior notice to personnel involved in the exercise, of at least one product lot that has been distributed in commerce. A hypothetical reason for recalling the product will be specified and will involve the activation of the recall plan. The simulation will proceed at least to the point at which communication is made beyond the firm’s organizational limits (full details of who will be contacted and how this will be established will be specified prior to the start of the exercise). In addition, the recall simulation exercises will include scenarios in which the recalled product has been shipped beyond the firm’s initial customer to one or more of the consignee’s customers. A recall simulation file is maintained by Fuerschlinger’s Better Meat Company to record the details and results of all simulated recall exercises. It includes the following information: • Name, address and telephone number of clients (of the test lot); • Production records; • Inventory; and • Distribution of the test lot. If problems are identified during a recall simulation exercise, our recall plan (and procedures) will be revised as necessary. The Fuerschlinger’s Better Meat Company Recall Plan will be reviewed biannually and revised as necessary, when personnel, procedures, processes, and other factors change. Recall Communication Templates The enclosed recall communication templates on pages 38-41 will be used by the company to develop Letters to Customers and Press Releases relating to recalled product(s) during actual recalls and simulation exercises.', 'Small Plant News Guidebook Series Small Plant News Guidebook Series A Sample Recall Plan: The Workbook RECALL COMMUNICATION TEMPLATE #1 Letter to Customers DATE CUSTOMER FIRM NAME & ADDRESS ATTN: CONTACT PERSON NAME & TITLE Re: RECALL OF TYPE OF PRODUCT Dear Sir or Madam: This letter is to confirm our telephone conversation that Fuerschlinger’s Better Meat Company is recalling the following product because Specify Recall Reason: Describe the product, including name, brand, code, package size and type, establishment number, etc. We request that you review your inventory records and segregate and hold the above product.
