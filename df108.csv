text_by_page,"['A Generic HACCP Model for New Poultry Inspection System (NPIS) The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) published the Pathogen Reduction/Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) Systems Final Rule in July 1996. The HACCP regulations (9 CFR Part 417) require establishments to develop and implement a system of controls designed to address safety hazards reasonably likely to occur in their production process. Therefore, this HACCP model’s focus, and the focus of the other HACCP models, is on product safety, not product quality characteristics. With the rule, FSIS made available a guidebook for the preparation of HACCP plans and a generic modelfor each food processing category defined inregulation (9 CFR 417.2(b)(1)). The guidebook and the generic models have been updated since their initial publication to be consistent with current science and policy. FSIS recommends you use of the updated Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans when developing an establishment-specific HACCP plan. Generic models serve as usefulexamples ofhow to meet the regulatory requirements. Each model represents a food processing category. Each processing category may contain numerous products. Therefore, each single model represents a category of products and, as such, the models do not demonstrate unique products or novel processes. The generic models are not intended to be used “as is”. FSIS recommends that establishments tailor the model(s) to fit the establishment’s operation. The model’s critical control points (CCPs) do not necessarily apply to all operations or products in the product category. Products or operations may require fewer or more CCPs depending on the operation. The flowdiagram demonstrates a general production process and should be modified toreflecttheprocesses used at theestablishment. The food safety criticallimits selected must come from scientific documents or other reliable sourcesto meet regulatory validation requirements. Each modelincludes references for guidance on the selection of critical limits. To select the model that will be most useful for the products produced, consider the production activity occurring (slaughter, cutting, grinding, smoking, cooking, etc.), the product (beef, pork, chicken, etc.), and the food safety characteristics of the final product produced (intact or nonintact, raw or ready-to-eat, requires refrigeration or is shelf-stable, etc.). Examine the list of processing categories (9 CFR 417.2(b)(1)) and group similar products according to the categories. Many similar products may be grouped under the same category and HACCP plan. Selection of the processing categories reveal which of the generic models might be useful. Selecting the most appropriate model to work from will save the establishment time and personnel resources. Deciding on a generic model is an important achievement for your establishment. The records produced while documenting a HACCP plan, including all documentation used to support the hazard analysis are HACCP records ((CFR 417.5(a)). The selection of processing categories and HACCP models are preliminary steps to completing a hazard analysis. The documents produced during the selection process are HACCP records. Ensure you maintain the documents produced while documenting a HACCP plan For further assistance with developing HACCP plans see the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans and the guidance materials available on the FSIS HACCP webpage.

No 10Refer to FSIS Meat and Poultry Hazards and Controls Guide and DRAFT FSIS Compliance Guideline For Controlling Salmonella and Campylobacter in Raw Poultry for suggested practices and controls. 10Hazards are grouped into three categories:Biological (B), Chemical (C), and Physical (P). Biological hazardsarelivingorganisms. Chemical hazardsmaybe naturallyoccurringin foods, used, or added duringthe processingoffoods, or administered to live animals. Physical hazards are acomponent of afood that is unexpected, such as plastic, glass, metal, or bone in a boneless product. See the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans for more information about hazards identification. 12 Place thejustification for your decision in column 4. Include control measures in column 4 for hazards not reasonably likely to occurand place them in column 5 for hazards reasonably likely to occur. If a hazard is reasonable likely to occur, then a CCP mustbeaddressed at this step or a later step. See FSISMeat and Poultry Hazards and Controls Guide for a list of frequently used controls. 13 Scientific references are important in making decisions, providing justifications, and validating the HACCPsystem. When scientific references are used for decisions, the referencedarticle must be part ofthe HACCP records. If the scientificjustificationis from FSIS, then list the document name. If justificationis not from an FSISprogram, then HACCP system design must be supported by documentary evidence –that is,the theoretical principles, expert advice from processing authorities, scientific or technical data, peerreviewed journal articles, pathogen modeling programs, or other information demonstrating that particular process control measures can adequately prevent, reduce, or eliminate specific hazards. These non-FSIS supporting documentsmust be kept for the life of the HACCP plan. 14 Because the results obtained under prerequisite programs could affect decisions made in the hazard analysis, an establishmentis required to maintain records associated with these programs as supporting documentation for its hazard analysis (9 CFR 417.5(a)). When an establishment determines that a potential hazard is not reasonably likely to occur because the implementation of a prerequisite program (e.g., Sanitation SOP,written sanitary dressing procedures incorporated into prerequisite programs, purchase specifications, antimicrobial interventions) prevents conditions that make the potential hazard likely, that prerequisite program then becomespart of the HACCP system and as a result, must be validated. This means thatestablishments must maintain scientific or technical support for the design of those prerequisiteprograms used to support decisions in the hazard analysis and must collect in-plant validation data to support that the programs are implemented as designed (see FSIS Compliance Guideline HACCP Systems Validation, page 5). 15 To developan effective CCP, see the FSIS Guidebook for thePreparationof HACCP Plans for a CCP decision tree and guidance on how to control, reduce, or eliminate a hazard.

When historical data is not available (for example,a HACCPplan for a new process or product), then system design must be supported by other documentary evidence. Such as the FSISMeat and Poultry Hazards and Controls Guide which states “monitor giblets forforeign materials” is a frequently used control for foreign material hazards in poultry slaughter.. 17ThisForeign MaterialSOP(prerequisite program) should have details on how this procedure is preventing the hazard from occurring (such asmetal prevention controls) as well as the on-going verification procedures. These controls should be evident within the written document upon review.

The list contains the allowable amounts and the intended use of the approved antimicrobials. The list (Directive 7120.1) can be used as supporting documentation for chemical hazard controls(safety and suitability). Directive 7120.1 cannot be used as support for the control of biological hazards because the antimicrobial concentration needed to control bacteria is different fromthe concentrations required for safety and suitability.

Randomly, once per day, an employee observes the measurement of the concentration of the antimicrobial solution at the point of application. Records Reviewed once a week (9 CFR 417.4(a)(2)(iii )). Organic Acid Spray Concentration Form. Corrective Action Log 26 If an establishment implements aprocess consistent with the process specifications described in the scientific support, and the scientific support containsmicrobiological data specifying the level of pathogen reduction achieved by the intervention strategy for the target pathogen identified in the hazard analysis, the in-plant validation data collected during the 90 day initial validation period will consist of data on quantifiable characteristics of the critical operational parameters, suchas pressure, temperature, and concentration. However,if an establishment implements different critical operational parameters in the process from the scientificsupport,or the scientificsupport identified does not contain microbiologicaldata, thenthe establishment should collect in-plant data demonstrating the criticaloperational parameters that ithas implemented can all be met AND should collect in-plant microbiologicalvalidation data or identify scientific support with microbiological data that demonstrates the effectiveness of those implemented critical operational parameter (FSIS Compliance Guideline HACCPSystems Validation, page 27). 27 Scientific or technical support is required to validate the critical limits and critical parameters (for example, time of exposure) of the organic acid spray. They are part ofthe hazard analysis and need to be maintained for the life of the HACCPplan (see FSISCompliance Guideline HACCPSystems Validation); FSIS Directive 7120.1 Safe and Suitable Ingredients Used in the Production of Meat, Poultry, and Egg Products contains approved substances for use in poultry; however, each establishment must validate their own process.

Check 10 carcasses for each production hour at random times selected during the production hour. Check up to 10 parts, giblets, necks or feet each production hour at random times selected during the production hour. If 10 units are not available at this time all units are checked. Designated employees If a deviation from the critical limit occurs, the production supervisor will, per 9 CFR 417.3(a): 1. Hold all product produced after the last acceptable check until appropriate disposition taken (no product injurious to health will enter commerce); 2. Determine and eliminate the cause of the deviation; 3. Bring the CCP under control; 4. Take measures Observe the person who monitors the CCP once each day the establishment slaughters.
