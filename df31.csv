The nutrition facts values for ground product an establishment manufactures may differ depending on the fat content of the trimmings or parts used as starting material.', 'Additional Information Regarding Nutrition Facts Formats 1. How large must the Nutrition Facts label be? Answer: There are no specific size requirements for the nutrition label. However, the “Nutrition Facts” heading must be in a type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label and generally set the full width of the nutrition facts label (9 CFR 317.309(d) and 381.409(d)). Minimum type sizes of 6 point and 8 point are required for the other information in the nutrition label, and there are minimum spacing requirements between lines of text. 2. What are the minimum type sizes and other format requirements for the Nutrition Facts label? Answer: The illustration below indicates an example of the graphics FSIS uses to display the Nutrition Facts label. Format requirements are specified in 9 CFR 317.309(d) and 381.409(d). Overall Nutrition Facts label is boxed with all black or one color type printed on a white or neutral background Typeface and Size 1. The Nutrition Facts label uses 6 point or larger Helvetica Black and/or Helvetica Regular type. In order to fit some formats the typography may be kerned as much as -4 (tighter kerning reduces legibility). 2. Key nutrients & their % Daily Value are set in 8 point Helvetica Black (but “%” is set in Helvetica Regular). 3. Nutrition Facts is set in either Franklin Gothic Heavy or Helvetica Black to fit the width of the label flush left and flush right.', '4. Serving Size and Servings per container are set in 8 point Helvetica Regular with 1 point of leading. 5. The table labels (for example, “Amount per Serving”) are set in 6 point Helvetica Black. 6. Absolute measures of nutrient content (for example, “1g”) and nutrient subgroups are set in 8 point Helvetica Regular with 4 points of leading. 7. Vitamins and minerals are set in 8 point Helvetica Regular, with 4 points of leading, separated by 10 point bullets. 8. All type that appears under vitamins and minerals is set in 6 point Helvetica Regular with 1 point of leading. Rules 1. A 7 point rule separates large groupings as shown in the example. A 3 point rule separates calorie information from the nutrient information. 2. A hairline rule or 1/4 point rule separates individual nutrients, as shown in the example. The top half of the label (nutrient information) has 2 points of leading between the type and the rules, the bottom half of the label (footnotes) has 1 point of leading between the type and the rules. Box All labels are enclosed by ½ point box rule within 3 points of text measure. 3. Must all of the type specifications shown with the nutrition format example (above) be followed? Answer: No. The mandatory type specifications are listed in 9 CFR 317.309(d) and 381.409(d). Unlike the illustrative example of section (above): 1. Any legible type style may be used, not just Helvetica. 2. The heading Nutrition Facts must be the largest type size in the nutrition label (i.e., it must be larger than 8-point, but does not need to be 13-point). 3. There is no specific thickness required for the three bars that separate the central sections of the nutrition label. 4. Can I use type sizes larger than 8 point and 6 point? Answer: The requirement for 6 and 8 point type sizes are minimum requirements. Larger type sizes may be used. 5. What can be done if the regular Nutrition Facts label (i.e., the vertical format) does not fit the package? Answer: On packages with more than 40 square inches available to bear labeling, the “side-by-side” format may be used if the regular Nutrition Facts label does not fit. In this format, the bottom part of the Nutrition Facts label (following the vitamin and mineral information) is placed immediately to the right and separated with a line. If additional vitamins and minerals are listed after iron and the space under iron is inadequate, they may also be listed to the right with a line that sets them apart from the footnotes.', 'Also, if the package has insufficient continuous vertical space (i.e., about 3 inches) to accommodate the above format, the nutrition label may be presented in a tabular (i.e., horizontal) display. Bilingual Format 6. On labels that have two languages, may nutrition information be provided in one bilingual Nutrition Facts label? Answer: When nutrition labeling must be presented in a second language, the nutrition information may be presented in separate nutrition labels for each language or in one label with the second language, translating all required information, following that in English. Numeric characters that are identical in both languages need not be repeated.', 'Simplified Format 7. What are the special labeling provisions for one or more mandatory nutrients being declared as “0?” Answer: The footnote after “*Percent Daily Values are based on a 2000 calorie diet” can be deleted.', 'Small Packages and Intermediate-Sized Packages 8. What are the special labeling provisions for small and intermediate-sized packages? Answer: Food packages with a surface area of 40 sq. in. or less available for labeling may place the Nutrition Facts label on any label panel (not limited to the information panel), may omit the footnote required in 9 CFR 317.309(d) and 381.409(d) if an asterisk is placed at the bottom of the label with the statement “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet,” and, may also use the tabular display label format. 9. Are abbreviations permitted in Nutrition Facts labels for small and intermediate-sized packages? Answer: Food packages with a surface area of 40 sq. in. or less available for labeling may use the following abbreviations in the Nutrition Facts label: Label Term Abbreviation Label Term Abbreviation Serving size Serv size Cholesterol Cholest Servings per container Servings Total carbohydrate Total carb Calories from fat Fat cal Dietary fiber Fiber Calories from saturated fat Sat fat cal Soluble fiber Sol fiber Saturated fat Sat fat Insoluble fiber Insol fiber Monounsaturated fat Monounsat fat Sugar alcohol Sugar alc Polyunsaturated fat Polyunsat fat Other carbohydrate Other carb 9 CFR 317.309(g)(2) and 381.409(g)(2)']"
