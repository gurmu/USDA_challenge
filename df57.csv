Washington, D.C. 20250 TO: See Distribution SUBJECT: Final Rule-Electronic Import Inspection Application, Certification of Imported Products, Foreign Establishments; Amendments to PHIS, Other Import Inspection Regulations The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) recently modified the meat, poultry, and egg products import regulations to allow foreign countries to certify shipments electronically, eliminating the need to issue a paper certificate. FSIS also modified its requirements for official inspection certificates to provide more flexibility to countries eligible to export products to the United States. Further, FSIS changed the annual certification of foreign establishments, and it clarified the U.S. prior notification requirements and the actions that FSIS will take when product for import is not presented for reinspection (FTP). On September 18,2014, FSIS announced these changes in a final rule in the U.S. Federal Register (Docket No. FSIS-2009-0022; Electronic Import Inspection Application and Certification of Imported Products and Foreign Establishments: Public Health Information System and Import Inspection Regulations), and it notified the World Trade Organization of the rule as well (SPS/N/USA/2484/Add.l). The final rule was effective on November 18, 2014; however, to ensure that foreign countries have sufficient time to adjust to the new requirements for certifying foreign establishments and additional product information on foreign inspection certificates, FSIS will allow countries to continue using existing inspection certificates until March 18,2015. Foreign Establishment Certificates: FSIS will continue to require each eligible country's competent authority to submit annual certification of eligible establishments. FSIS sent a letter to each competent authority on December 16, 2014, requesting this certification; however, the December 16letter did not include the updated requirements that are contained in the final rule and discussed in Attachment 1 of this letter. Attachment 1 describes the changes designed to minimize the burden on foreign governments by reducing the information required for countries currently exporting to the United States that are not changing the previous year's annual establishment certification. Attachment 1 also includes the requirements for countries eligible to export to the United States that are changing the previous year's certification, or providing an initial certification. An Equal Opportunity Provider and Employer"", ""Foreign Inspection Certificates: FSIS requires each eligible country's competent authority to certify shipments of product to the United States (9 CFR 327.4 (a) and (b), 381.197, and 590.915). After November 18, 2014, when foreign governments certify shipments electronically, FSIS no longer requires a paper copy of the certificate. You can find requirements for paper-based and electronic foreign inspection certificates in Attachment 2. Furthermore, FSIS has deleted certain requirements for the certification statements on foreign inspection certificates to provide foreign countries with more flexibility. For paper-based foreign inspection certificates, the competent authority must certify that any product described on any official certificate is in compliance with requirements equivalent to U.S. domestic requirements. Foreign countries have the option to continue using the current certification statements or can certify to the applicable regulatory requirements (e.g. §327.2 (meat or meat products) or §381.196 (poultry or poultry products) or 590.910 (egg products)). Foreign governments can refer to the Codex Alimentarius generic model official certificate as a guideline for organizing the required data elements on an official certificate. The certificate guideline (CAC/GL 38-2001) can be found on the Codex Alimentarius Web site at: http://www.codexalimentarius.org/standards/list-of-standards. Questions about foreign inspection certificates should be submitted to FSIS at IntemationalEquivalence@fsis. usda. gov. Application for Import Inspection and Prior Notification: For foreign countries' awareness, FSIS also amended its regulations (9 CFR 327.5, 381.198, and 590.920) for the Import Inspection Application (FSIS Form 9540-1). These changes apply only to U.S. importers or brokers but could affect certified shipments destined for export to the United States if U.S. importers/brokers do not meet the requirements. U.S. importers and brokers have the option of submitting the application electronically through U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) utilizing the Partner Government Agency (PGA) Message Set or on paper. FSIS will expand the PGA Message Set to include all ports, as well as all interested importers and brokers. For importers or brokers that electronically file entries with CBP using the PGA Message Set, this entry will replace the paper inspection application. U.S. importers or brokers that do not file the full PGA Message Set data must continue to submit paper applications to FSIS at the official import inspection establishment or other PSIS-approved location designated on the import inspection application. FSIS will enter the additional required FSIS data into the Public Health Information System (PHIS) Import Component by using information from the paper Import Inspection Application. An Equal Opportunity Provider and Employer"", ""The final rule requires U.S. importers or brokers to submit electronic or paper import inspection applications to FSIS in advance ofthe shipment's arrival, but no later than when the initial entry is filed with CBP. If the U.S. importer or broker files the PGA Message Set with their Customs entry, this requirement is met. If the U.S. importer or broker is using the paper applications, this must be provided to FSIS in advance of the shipment's arrival at the official import inspection establishment (or other FSIS approved location designated on the import inspection application), and no later than when the entry is made with CBP. Ifthe application has not been received prior to the shipment's arrival, FSIS will notify the establishment management of the violation, and that future shipments that do not meet the prior notification requirement may be refused entry. The objective ofthe prior notification requirement is to ensure that there is notice and data entry in PHIS is performed well before the shipment arrives at the official import inspection establishment. Importers and brokers that do not utilize PGA Message Set are to transition from the current FSIS Form 9540-1 to the revised Import Inspection Application (FSIS Form 9540-1) no later than March 18,2015. Failure to Present (FTP): Imported meat, poultry, and egg products that have entered commerce without FSIS import reinspection violate the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601-695); the Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 451--472); or the Egg Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 1031-1056), as well as the implementing regulations for each Act (9 CFR 327.6; 381.199; 590.925). It is the U.S. importer's responsibility to present the imported product to FSIS, but there could be negative impact on the exporting company if the product enters commerce illegally (e.g., FSIS may request the importer of record conduct a voluntary recall ofproduct·in commerce). To help prevent future FTPs, FSIS will provide FTP notifications to the foreign competent authority. The foreign competent authority may then notify the exporter, as appropriate, to help ensure that future shipments will be presented to FSIS. An Equal Opportunity Provider and Employer"", ""While these regulatory changes provide for efficiencies at the port-of-entry, please be aware that FSIS will continue to require all shipments of meat, poultry, and egg products exported to the United States to be certified by the foreign country's competent authority and presented for reinspection at the designated FSIS official import inspection establishment or alternative inspection location authorized by FSIS. FSIS also will continue to perform verification activities at the designated official import inspection establishment on these imported products, prior to release into commerce. FSIS intends to work with foreign governments, industry, and all interested stakeholders in implementing these changes. In particular, we believe that progressing toward a more electronic environment will benefit the Agency, industry, and most of all, the public health.

Engeljohn, PhD Assistant Administrator Office of Policy and Program Development An Equal Opportunity Provider and Employer"", ""Attachment 1: Foreign Establishment Certificate Requirements 1) Countries currently exporting to the United States that are making no changes to the previous year's annual establishment certification should submit the foreign establishment's name and control number (e.g. the establishment number assigned by the foreign inspection agency). The foreign official's title and signature is required for paper-copy submissions. FSIS does not require the foreign official's title and signature for foreign governments that electronically transmit foreign establishment certifications. 2) For countries providing an initial certification or countries currently exporting to the United States that are adding new establishments or listing any establishment for which information from last year's certificate has changed, the following information should be submitted for the new or changed establishments: • foreign establishment's name address, and control number; • foreign official's title, signature, and date (paper certificates only); • type of operations conducted at the foreign establishment (e.g., slaughter, processing, storage, exporting warehouse); • the establishment's eligibility status (e.g., new or relisted (if previously de listed) and, • for slaughter and processing establishments only, the species and type of products produced, such as the process category. The process categories include raw non-intact; raw -intact; thermally processed -commercially sterile; not heat treated -shelf stable; heat treated -shelf stable; fully cooked -not shelf stable; heat treated but not fully cooked -not shelf stable; and, products with secondary inhibitors -not shelf stable, and egg products."", ""Attachment 2: Foreign Inspection Certificate Requirements 1) For paper-based foreign inspection certificates, FSIS requires the following information, in English, for all meat, poultry, and egg products: • date, name, and title of the official authorized to issue inspection certificates for products imported into the United States; • the official seal ofthe foreign government responsible for the inspection ofthe product; • foreign country of export and the producing foreign establishment number; • species used to produce the product and the source country and foreign establishment number, if the source materials originate from a country other than the exporting country; • product's description, including the process category, the product category, and the product group (see Attachment 3); • name and address of the exporter or consignor; • name and address ofthe importer or consignee; • number of units (pieces or containers) and the shipping or identification mark on the units; • net weight of each lot, • production dates or codes used when country or establishment was ineligible. When production codes are used on product from establishments that have been delisted or relisted the codes must be translated into dates on the inspection certificate, and • any additional information needed by FSIS to determine whether the product is eligible to be imported into the United States., 2) For electronic foreign inspection certification, FSIS requires the same information listed above for paper-based certificates, except the name and title of the official authorized to issue inspection certificates for products imported into the United States."", 'Attachment 3: Product Categorization FSIS has developed this document to assist with accurate identification of the meat, poultry, and egg products certified for export to the United States. Process Category: There are nine (9) process categories identified in 9CFR 417 .2(b ). Of the nine (9) listed, Slaughter is considered an internal process that occurs in establishments where the animals or birds are slaughtered. This category is not used for imported products. An additional process category that is not contained in 9CFR 417 .2(b) is Egg Products. Note that FSIS has recently renamed two process categories: Raw Product-Ground and Raw ProductNot Ground are now referred to as Raw Product-Non-Intact and Raw Product-Intact, respectively. However, use of either terminology will be acceptable to FSIS. Note that official foreign inspection certificates should reflect the process category name, rather than the obsolete coding previously used by FSIS (e.g. 03B, 03C, etc.). These codes have been included in the table as some countries previously certified the process categories on the inspection certificates with this coding. Raw Product-Non-Intact: This process category applies to establishments that further process by using processing steps such as grinding, comminuting, injecting product with solutions, or mechanical tenderization by needling, cubing, pounding devices or other means of creating non-intact product. Examples of finished products in this category include raw products reconstructed into formed entrees, mechanically separated species and advanced meat recovery product. If the establishment produces bench trim or pieces of meat produced from non-intact meat, then the bench trim or pieces are also considered non-intact. Raw Product-Intact: FSIS considers raw products to be intact unless they have undergone any of the processes associated with the Raw Product-Non-Intact process category. Thermally Processed -Commercially Sterile: This process category applies to establishments that use a thermal processing step. Thermally processed, commercially sterile finished products are products in cans or flexible containers such as pouches, or semi-rigid, as in lunch bowls. Thermally processed, commercially sterile products are addressed in Subpart G, 318.300-311 for meat food products, and Subpart X, 381.300 to 311, for poultry products. Not Heat Treated-Shelf Stable: This process category applies to establishments that further process by curing, drying, or fermenting processing step as the sole means by which product achieves food safety. Establishments in this process category may apply a low-level heat treatment as long as the heat treatment is not used as means to achieve food safety. The finished products produced under this Process Categories are shelf stable. FSIS does not require shelf stable products to be frozen or refrigerated for food safety purposes. Heat Treated-Shelf Stable: This process category applies to establishments that further process by using a heat treatment processing step to achieve food safety in combination with curing, drying, or fermenting processing step to achieve food safety. The finished products produced under this process category are shelf stable. FSIS does not require shelf stable products to be frozen or refrigerated for food safety purposes. If the establishment produces using the processing steps applicable under this process category', ""and the product is not shelf stable, then establishment is producing product under the process category Fully Cooked-Not Shelf Stable. Fully Cooked-Not Shelf Stable: This process category applies to establishments that further process products by using primarily a full lethality heat process step (e.g. cooking) to achieve food safety. The finished products that establishments produce under this process category are not shelf stable. FSIS requires the products to be frozen or refrigerated for food safety purposes. These products also meet the definition of Ready to Eat (RTE) as defined in 9 CFR 430.1. Heat Treated but Not Fully Cooked-Not Shelf Stable: This process category applies to an establishment that further processes products that are (1) not ready-to-eat products (NRTE) or (2) raw otherwise processed products that are refrigerated or frozen throughout the product's shelf life. Meat and poultry products are produced using a heat process that meets one of the following criteria: a. The heat processing step is not adequate to achieve food safety. Products may be partially cooked or heated to set batter on a raw product. b. The heat processing step applied to meat or poultry component was adequate to achieve food safety, however product is further processed, assembled, or packaged so that cooked meat or poultry products contacts non-ready to-eat product ingredients. In this case, the final product is in a form that is not edible without additional preparing to achieve food safety. An example ofthis product is pot pie product that contains cooked chicken and raw dough. NOTE: This category may also include products that receive a full lethality treatment but there is no standard of identity defining them as fully cooked (e.g., hotdogs or barbecue) or a common or usual name that consumers understand to refer toRTE product (e.g., pates). Products with Secondary Inhibitors-Not Shelf Stable: This process category applies to establishments that further process by using a curing processing step or a processing step using other ingredients that inhibit bacterial growth. These products are generally refrigerated or frozen throughout the product's shelf life. Depending on the process and ingredients, these products may or may not meet the definition of RTE as defined in 9 CFR 430.1. Eggs/Egg Products: This process category applies to dried, pasteurized and unpasteurized egg products. Product Category (with Applicable Species) The Product Categories are shown in the PSIS Product Categorization table with the appropriate species indicated for each. The Species designations PSIS is using for PHIS are: for Meat: Beef, Veal, Pork, Lamb, Mutton, and Goat; for Poultry: Chicken, Turkey, Duck, Goose, Guinea, and Squab, including for Ratites: Emu, Ostrich, and Rhea; for Eggs: Chicken, Turkey, Duck, Goose and Guinea; and for Egg Products: Chicken, Turkey, Duck, Goose, and Guinea. For each product, the certification must indicate which species is predominant in the product to assure the appropriate regulations are applied to the product when applicable. Product Group. The product group defines the product down to a level that PSIS can program appropriate types of inspections (TOI) for examinations and laboratory sampling. Regulatory references are added where applicable for clarification. While these appear to be self-explanatory, for Raw Product-Intact, Cuts are cuts of meat (e.g., steaks, chops, etc.) that are below the Primal and Subprimallevel."", 'The following table displays the process categories and the types of finished products that can be present in a process category. Finished Product Types by Process Cate~ory Process Categories Finished Products Raw Product NRTE Product RTE Products Thermally Processed Product Slaughter • Raw -Non Intact (Raw Ground) • Raw-Intact (Raw Not Ground) • Thermally Processed-Commercially Sterile • Not Heat-Treated -Shelf Stable • • Heat Treated -Shelf Stable • • Fully Cooked-Not Shelf Stable • Heat Treated but Not Fully CookedNot Shelf Stable • Product with Secondary Inhibitors-Not Shelf Stable • • Eggs/Egg Products Not Applicable Ready to Eat applies to any product intended for human consumption without further preparation steps. Note: Products that appear fully cooked or are customarily consumed without further preparation, but the label does not include cooking instructions, are by default considered RTE. RTE fully cooked means that the products have been sufficiently cooked so that they are safe to eat as they are, with no further preparation required by the consumer. Note: Many of these products are customarily eaten hot, and heating instructions may be included on the label. Some frozen RTE products require reheating for palatability. These frozen products are still safe to eat without this further preparation by the consumer and are therefore still considered RTE. Some examples include: fully cooked hams, cooked beef, roast beef, pastrami, corned beef, hot dogs, meat loaves, meat and poultry salads, sliced luncheon meats, baked chicken, frozen entrees, and poultry rolls. Fresh or frozen entrees with fully cooked meat or poultry portions combined with fully cooked sauces, vegetables, pasta, or other ingredients are RTE products. These products are designed to be re-heated by the consumer, and may include instructions for re-heating. Not Ready to Eat applies to products with cooking instructions or labeled with statements on the principal display panel such as ""Cook Thoroughly, Cook and Serve, Not Ready to Eat, or For Safety and Quality-follow these cooking instructions."" These products are considered NRTE. Certain NRTE products are required to bear safe handling instructions (SHl).', 'Some NRTE finished products are heat treated but are not fully cooked. These NRTE products should have sufficient labeling information to inform the consumer that the product must be cooked for safety. This information may be contained within the product name on the principal display panel, and may contain cooking instructions that refer to cooking the product for safety rather than heating the product for best quality. The product often times may bear a safe handling instruction. Some NRTE finished products are prepared with both meat/poultry components that have received a lethality treatment in combination with non-meat/poultry components that need to receive a lethality treatment. These multi-component products, e.g., meals, dinners, and entrees, have labeling features which are conspicuous so that intended users are fully aware that the product must be cooked for safety. The principle display panel on the label defines these products, e.g., ""Cook and Serve, ""Must be thoroughly cooked,"" ""Cook before eating"", and the product should include cooking instructions when required.
