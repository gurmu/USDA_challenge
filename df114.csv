text_by_page,"['Page 1 of 20 A Generic HACCP Model for New Swine Inspection System (NSIS) The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) published the Pathogen Reduction/Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) Systems Final Rule in July 1996. The HACCP regulations (9 CFR Part 417) require establishments to develop and implement a system of controls designed to address safety hazards reasonably likely to occur in their production process. Therefore, this HACCP model’s focus, and the focus of the other HACCP models, is on product safety, not product quality characteristics. With the rule, FSIS made available a guidebook for the preparation of HACCP plans and a generic model for each food processing category defined in the regulation (9 CFR 417.2(b)(1)). The guidebook and the generic models have been updated since their initial publication to be consistent with current science and policy. FSIS recommends you use the updated Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans when developing an establishment-specific HACCP plan. Generic models serve as useful examples of how to meet the regulatory requirements. Each model represents a food processing category. Each processing category may contain numerous products. Therefore, each single model represents a category of products and, as such, the models do not demonstrate unique products or novel processes. The generic models are not intended to be used “as is”. FSIS recommends that establishments tailor the model(s) to fit the establishment’s operation. Establishments that slaughter market hogs may choose to operate under NSIS. Market hog slaughter establishments that do not choose to operate under the NSIS may operate under the traditional inspection system. FSIS has published a generic HACCP model for Traditional Swine Slaughter. The NSIS model’s critical control points (CCPs) do not necessarily apply to all NSIS operations. Products or operations may require fewer or more CCPs depending on the operation. The flow diagram demonstrates a general production process and should be modified to reflect the processes used at the establishment. The food safety critical limits selected must come from scientific documents or other reliable sources to meet regulatory validation requirements. This model includes references for guidance on the selection of critical limits. The records produced while documenting a HACCP plan, including all documentation used to support the hazard analysis are HACCP records (CFR 417.5(a)). Ensure you maintain the documents produced while developing a HACCP plan. For further assistance with developing HACCP plans see the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans and the guidance materials available on the FSIS HACCP webpage.', 'Page 2 of 20 EXAMPLE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION1 Process / Product Name: New Swine Inspection System (NSIS) Market Hog Slaughter and Variety Meats Process / Product name NSIS Market Hog Slaughter and Variety Meats (carcasses, variety meats (offal) and head meat) Important product characteristics (Aw, pH, Preservatives, etc.) Not Applicable Intended use2 For further processing at this facility or another establishment or Intended for cooking by end consumer Packaging (durability and storage conditions) Vacuum-packaged, bagged, boxed or in combos (catch weights) Shelf life and at what temperature Carcasses: 7 days when stored at less than 40℉ Variety Meats: 15 days at less than 40℉, Frozen – 180 Days at less than 10℉ Where it will be sold (specify intended consumers, especially at-risk populations3) Carcasses and variety meats are either further processed inhouse or sold direct to another establishment or to household consumers through retail outlets or distributed to hotels, restaurants, and institutions (HRI).

The FSIS Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans and the NSIS generic HACCP model are intended for establishments seeking assistance in understanding the requirements in Title 9 Code of Federal Regulations (9 CFR) Part 417. The HACCP model is for demonstration purposes only. The model does not represent requirements that must be met. Establishments are required to develop HACCP plans specific to their facilities, production practices, and products. 2 The intended use or consumer of the product must be identified in accordance with 9 CFR 417.2(a)(2). Identifying the product’s intended use in the product description is one way to meet the regulatory requirements specific to 417.2(a)(2). 3 At-risk populations include young children, the elderly and immunocompromised persons.', 'Page 3 of 20 EXAMPLE LIST OF PRODUCT INGREDIENTS AND INCOMING MATERIAL4 Process / Product Name: NSIS Market Hog Slaughter and Variety Meats Meat and meat by-products Live hogs Non-meat food ingredients None Antimicrobials5 or processing aids6 Scald agents, organic acid Packaging material Foam bone protectors, cardboard boxes and combos, selfadhesive labels, plastic vacuum bags, plastic combo bin and box liners.

This is important to help identify any special ingredients or processes to address in the HACCP plan. 5 FSIS and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that establishes the working relationship followed when responding to notifications for the use of food additives (including ingredients) intended for use in the production of FSIS regulated products. FSIS determines the suitability of the use of food ingredients used in the production of meat, poultry, and egg products. FSIS consults, as necessary, with FDA on the requirements under the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations. See FSIS Directive 7120.1, Safe and Suitable Ingredients Used in Meat Poultry and Egg Products for the list of suitable ingredients. 6 There are many different organic acids (for example, lactic acid, acetic acid). Establishments will need to research the various organic acids and select the antimicrobial intervention best suited for their unique circumstances and validate its effectiveness. Antimicrobial agents are listed in FSIS Directive 7120.1 Safe and Suitable Ingredients used in the Production of Meat, Poultry, and Egg Products.', 'Page 4 of 20 EXAMPLE PROCESS FLOW DIAGRAM7 Process / Product Name: NSIS Market Hog Slaughter and Variety Meats 17.

Biological hazards are living organisms. Chemical hazards may be naturally occurring in foods, used, or added during the processing of foods, or administered to live animals. Physical hazards are a component of a food that is unexpected, such as plastic, glass, metal, or bone in a boneless product. See the Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans for more information about hazards identification. 12 Place the justification for your decision in column 4. Include control measures in column 4 for hazards not reasonably likely to occur and place them in column 5 for hazards reasonably likely to occur. If a hazard is reasonable likely to occur, then a CCP must be addressed at this step or a later step. See FSIS Meat and Poultry Hazards and Controls Guide for a list of frequently used controls. 13 Scientific references are important in making decisions, providing justifications, and validating the HACCP system. When scientific references are used for decisions, the referenced article must be part of the HACCP records. If the scientific justification is from FSIS, then list the document name. If justification is not from an FSIS program, then HACCP system design must be supported by documentary evidence – that is, the theoretical principles, expert advice from processing authorities, scientific or technical data, peer-reviewed journal articles, pathogen modeling programs, or other information demonstrating that particular process control measures can adequately prevent, reduce, or eliminate specific hazards. These non-FSIS supporting documents must be kept for the life of the HACCP plan. 14 Because the results obtained under prerequisite programs could affect decisions made in the hazard analysis, an establishment is required to maintain records associated with these programs as supporting documentation for its hazard analysis (9 CFR 417.5(a)). When an establishment determines that a potential hazard is not reasonably likely to occur because the implementation of a prerequisite program (e.g., Sanitation SOP, written sanitary dressing procedures incorporated into prerequisite programs, purchase specifications, antimicrobial interventions) prevents conditions that make the potential hazard likely, that prerequisite program then becomes part of the HACCP system and as a result, must be validated. This means that establishments must maintain scientific or technical support for the design of those prerequisite programs used to support decisions in the hazard analysis and must collect in-plant validation data to support that the programs are implemented as designed (see FSIS Compliance Guideline HACCP Systems Validation, page 5). 15 To determine a CCP, see Guidebook for the Preparation of HACCP Plans for a CCP decision tree. Use the tool to evaluate the areas of control (column 5) to determine the best CCP to control, reduce, or eliminate a hazard.

The Foreign Material SOP and plant data related to ongoing verification activities then become part of recordkeeping and historic data. 18 Note: this “historical data” must be supported with evidence from the establishment through the establishment’s history or validation data with reference to the actual SOP or prerequisite program. When historical data is not available (for example, a HACCP plan for a new process or product), then system design must be supported by other documentary evidence, such as the FSIS Meat and Poultry Hazards and Controls Guide which states “visual examination of carcass for foreign material during slaughter” is a frequently used control for foreign material hazards in swine slaughter. 19 The criteria used to determine when the live wash will be used should be clearly established in a prerequisite program.

The supervisor will determine the cause of the deviation, take whatever measures are necessary to restore the CCP to control, and document the corrective actions in the Corrective Actions log. If more than one deviation is found in a shift, the line will be slowed x% until xx minutes’ production successfully passes the CCP.” 32 One form for all three CCP monitoring locations and verification activities.', 'Page 20 of 20 33 FSIS Directive 7120.1, Safe and Suitable Ingredients Used in Meat, Poultry and Egg Products identifies the ingredients that are safe to use; however, each establishment must validate their own process. See FSIS Compliance Guideline HACCP Systems Validation for validation guidance. 34 FSIS does not endorse any specific antimicrobial intervention. “Organic acid” is used as an example. If an antimicrobial is used, each establishment will need to find an antimicrobial intervention that works with their unique situation and they will need to validate the product’s use. The critical limits should closely match the specific parameters for use as found in the technical or scientific supporting documentation. 35 NOTE: Critical operating parameters need to be addressed in this section as they are related to the scientific justification for use. Critical parameters include but are not limited to the following: type of sprayer (hand, cabinet), volume, coverage, chemical contact time, solution temperature, etc. The defined operational parameters are specific to each establishment. Example NSIS Market Hog Slaughter HACCP Plan Critical Control Point (CCP) Significant Hazard(s) Critical Limits for Each Control Measure33 Monitoring Procedures Corrective Action Verification Records What How Frequency Who CCP 4 Organic Acid Spray (Carcass, head meat, cheek meat, weasand meat, and offal) B: Pathogens: Salmonella The application of an organic acid34 (for example, organic acid at 25%). Mix solution per manufacturer’s instructions to achieve 2-5% solution of organic acid not to exceed 55oC (131oF) sprayed directly onto carcasses, head meat, cheek meat, weasand meat and offal at 20-30 psi35 until all surfaces are dripping wet and some of the solution drips off. Observe the preparation and mixing of the solution and its application to verify the operational parameters are achieved. Observe the mixing of the solution and test the concentration of the organic acid (test kit). Observe the pressure gauges to determine the pressure at which the solution is being applied. Check thermometer for the temperature of the solution at the point of application. Observe for complete coverage of the product at the point the solution is applied. Once during each hour of slaughter operations. QA Tech or designee If a deviation from the critical limit occurs, the QA manager or designee will take corrective actions per 9 CFR 417.3(a): 1. Hold all product produced after the last acceptable check until appropriate disposition taken (no product injurious to health will enter commerce); 2. Determine and eliminate the cause of the deviation; 3. Bring the CCP under control; and 4. Take measures to prevent recurrence. Randomly, once per week, QA Manager observes QA Tech performing monitoring functions. Each week, a QA Tech calibrates the pressure of the sprayers per manufacturer’s instructions. Weekly calibrate cabinet thermometers by checking temperature with a calibrated hand-held thermometer. Daily Records Review QA will review Organic Acid Wash CCP CCP 4 Organic Acid Spray Form.
