FSIS microbiological sampling and testing programs are implemented to ensure that establishments maintain control of their production processes and adhere to FSIS regulations, policies and pathogen performance standards. Ongoing government sampling in FSIS-regulated domestic establishments allows FSIS to assess the effectiveness of industry process controls, compliance with performance standards, and other efforts to control the presence of pathogens in FSIS-regulated meat, poultry, and processed egg products. These microbiological sampling and testing programs are an important component of the FSIS mission to protect the health and welfare of consumers by regulating the meat, poultry, and egg products produced in federally-inspected establishments and to prevent the distribution into commerce of any such products that are adulterated or misbranded. FSIS conducts routine microbiological sampling and testing for Salmonella, Campylobacter, Listeria monocytogenes, and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), including E. coli O157:H7 and six non-O157 STEC (O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, and O145). The analyses for these pathogens are conducted using methods as outlined in the FSIS Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook (MLG). In this attachment, FSIS is providing a summary (Tables 1-3) of the frequency of government sampling and the microbiological analyses performed by FSIS. Central competent authorities (CCAs) can use this information as a reference when implementing government microbiological testing. The tables also include test portions analyzed by FSIS for each of these sampling programs.

Alternatively, the CCA may choose to use the volume of products that are exported to the US to categorize establishments eligible to export in order to determine the appropriate frequency for testing. If the frequency of sampling is based on volume of products exported to the US, the corresponding volume ranges would be: Very Small Est (<20,000 lbs./month exported to the US), Small Est (20,001-100,000 lbs./month exported to the US), Medium Est (100,001-5,000,000 lbs./month exported to the US), Large Est (>5,000,000 lbs./month exported to the US). 5 FSIS suspended official government verification of compliance with the Salmonella performance standards in beef (steers/heifers and cows/bulls) and swine (market hog) carcasses (2011), as well as in raw ground beef (2014), because the percentage of positive findings was very low in carcasses and because of methods changes in ground beef. CCAs need to provide their performance standard criteria for evaluation of Salmonella results, including how the CCA assesses on an ongoing basis whether certified establishments meet performance standards for carcasses (cow/bull, steer/heifer, and swine) and raw ground beef. Alternatively, if the CCA has been following the FSIS standards but wants to make changes to its program, CCAs can request an individual sanitary measure (ISM) determination and submit data to support that their measure provides an equivalent level of public health protection.', 'Summary of FSIS Government Microbiological Sampling Programs Frequencies NOTE: This document is updated from the 2018 version.

Therefore, at this time, FSIS is not currently assessing Campylobacter performance in poultry establishments and is currently revising the Campylobacter performance standards based on the enrichment method.', 'Summary of FSIS Government Microbiological Sampling Programs Frequencies NOTE: This document is updated from the 2018 version.
