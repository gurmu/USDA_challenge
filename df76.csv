text_by_page,"['11/03/2016 Steps to Obtain Level 2 eAuthentication Credentials and PHIS Access In February 2015, FSIS announced to countries that are interested in exporting product to the United States (US) the availability of its web-based Self-Reporting Tool (SRT) within FSIS’s web-based Public Health Information System (PHIS). Please refer to the Federal Register announcement (80 FR 9428) for additional information. The benefits for using the web-based SRT are expedited SRT review process, transparency, and security. Each year it will only be necessary for countries to reflect any changes that have occurred within their inspection systems since the last submission of the SRT. Participating countries will be able to log onto PHIS at any time to view their SRT and its status on a personalized homepage. It is important to understand that the level 2 eAuthentication credentialing and PHIS enrollment are two separate processes. It is important to note that when the designated central competent authority (CCA) official becomes level 2 eAuthentication credentialed, the PHIS enrollment process is not automatically initiated. As these processes are independent from one another, it will take time to complete both of these processes. To start the level 2 eAuthentication credentialing process, a country first needs to identify a designated CCA official. This identified official will be responsible for entering the SRT responses and uploading supporting documents into PHIS. This official is responsible for first obtaining level 2 eAuthentication credentials, and then requesting to be enrolled in PHIS to complete the SRT. The following steps clarify how an official can obtain access to the SRT. 1. To obtain level 2 eAuthentication credentials, the official must first complete the level 2 registration form. Please visit http://1.usa.gov/1rbeFcL to complete registration. REMINDER: All red asterisk (*) fields must be filled in to successfully complete the registration form. 2. The official will receive a confirmation e-mail with the subject line, ""eAuthentication - Action Required - Instructions to Activate Your USDA Account with Level 2 Access"" within 1 hour. The official must activate the account within seven (7) days to complete the registration form process. Please check your junk e-mail for the confirmation e-mail. For more information on eAuthentication please visit the eAuthentication Help webpage (https://www.eauth.usda.gov/MainPages/eauthHelp.aspx) or review the eAuthentication Frequently Asked Questions document (https://www.eauth.usda.gov/_GlobalAssets/Documents/USDA_eAuth_FAQ.pdf). If you have not received your confirmation e-mail once you have activated your account, please contact Ms. Monica Marcelli at monica.marcelli@fsis.usda.gov or via telephone at 1 (202) 720-0473. Ms. Marcelli will help the official to schedule the appointment with the Local Registration Authority (LRA) to verify his or her government issued photo identification. If the official is based at an embassy in Washington DC, or visiting Washington DC, he or she can meet with the LRA at the United States Department of Agriculture building to complete the eAuthentication credentialing process. If the official is not in the US, FSIS can make arrangements to complete the credentialing process while in country. 3. Upon confirming the official’s identity, the LRA will send the official a confirmation e-mail stating that level 2 eAuthentication credentials have been granted. Upon receiving confirmation, the official will now be able to enroll in PHIS in order to manage and submit its SRT to FSIS electronically. To enroll in PHIS, visit https://phis.fsis.usda.gov and login using your Level 2 eAuthentication credentials. To login, use the same username and password created when the level 2 registration form was completed. Use the following steps to complete the PHIS enrollment process. a. On the Welcome to FSIS Enrollment Application page, click Submit Enrollment Request. b. On the FSIS Enrollment Request Wizard (1) select Foreign Country, (2) enter the Central Competent Authority contact information, (3) select Central Competent Authority, (4) select your country, and (5) enter specific personal contact information. c. Once you have completed the Enrollment Request Wizard, review. If you need to edit information, click Previous until you get to the desired page to edit. Once complete, click Finish and click Logout eAuth (in upper', '11/03/2016 right hand corner). An enrollment confirmation number will appear. Please document (or print) that number for your records. Once the official has submitted his or her enrollment request for PHIS, please contact Ms. Marcelli to provide her the enrollment number, or the e-mail address or last name of the contact person entered into the PHIS enrollment form. An e-mail will be sent to the official notifying them that their request has been approved. Once PHIS enrollment has been approved if the official cannot log into PHIS after 24 hours, please contact Ms. Marcelli. REMINDERS: Log into PHIS at least every 60 days to prevent your account from being disabled. If the official’s PHIS account becomes disabled, he or she must make sure that his or her level 2 eAuthentication password is up-to-date, and then contact Ms. Marcelli for further assistance. For officials that are enrolled in PHIS, FSIS will send reminder e-mails to log into PHIS. For security reasons, eAuthentication will occasionally prompt you to change your password. If it is time to change your password, the system will prompt you to change your password. If the official is not able to log into PHIS because he or she has locked the level 2 eAuthentication account by trying to enter his or her password too many times, please contact the eAuthentication Help Desk at 1-800-457-3642, and select Option 1 or e-mail eAuthHelpDesk@ftc.usda.gov. The official may be prompted to answer security questions that he or she set up while completing the eAuthentication registration form. Lastly, the USDA does not permit sharing accounts or passwords.']"
