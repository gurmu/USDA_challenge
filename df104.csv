The Guide identifies relevant process steps, lists potentialhazardsforeach of theseprocess steps, and cites controls frequently used by processors to address these hazards. Using this Guide, FSIS personnel should be able to verify more effectively that an egg products plant’s food safety system is adequately identifying and controlling the hazards associated with its operations. This Guide should be used with the following principles in mind: • This Guide is not intended to suggest where Critical Control Points (CCPs) should be incorporated in a plant’s HACCP system. • The statement “no common hazard” in the Guide is based on the information that is currently available and may change based on research or outbreak and recall investigations. Unforeseen hazards and the results ofHACCPsystemreassessments may also identify a possible hazard in a process step where none was previously identified. • The potential hazards listed may not be the only possible hazards for a particular process step. • The entries in the “Frequently Used Controls” column are not the only valid controls that plants may include in their HACCP systems for a particular hazard. • A set of suggested general and process-specific verification questions are included in this Guideaftereach process step listed. Thesequestionsare intended to guide FSIS personnel when evaluating a plant’s HACCP system and specifically its process steps and totrigger additional questions. It is important forFSIS personnelto realize that these questions are not meant to be all-inclusive, but to provide examples of the types of questions that may arise when verifying the adequacy of a plant’s HACCP system and regulatory compliance. This Guide should also be useful to plant personnel, particularly those in small and very small plants. However, the potentialhazards and frequently used controlslistedin this Guide are neither the only possible hazards nor the only applicable process controls available to a plant operator. Each plant must design its HACCP system to address thosehazards that are reasonably likely to occur in its own specific production processes. The Guide consists of the following major sections: • Quick reference table of process steps in alphabetical order for the most common process steps in the production of egg products; • General verification questions for most process steps; and • A listingof individualprocess steps withcurrently identified potentialhazards and frequently used controls. 1', 'Quick Reference Table of Process Steps in Alphabetical Order by Product Category Process Steps Page No. Raw/NRTE RTE Not Shelf Stable RTE Shelf Stable Blending of dry ingredients into dried egg product 19 • Breaking and separating of eggs 10 • Classification and sorting, ca ndling, a nd tra nsfer of shell eggs 8 • Defrosting 12 • • Desugaring/fermentation 15 • • Egg washing/sanitizer 9 • Formulation/mixing/ homogenization/ reconstitution of dried product 13 • • Freezing 20 • • Heat treatment of dried egg whites 17 • Liquid egg cooling and holding 11 • • Packaging/repackaging 22 • • • Pasteurization 14 • Receiving and storage of packaging materials and non-egg ingredients 7 • • • Receiving and storage of raw/NRTE liquid egg products 5 • Receiving and storage of RTE egg products (liquid/dried) 6 • • Receiving and storage of shell eggs prior to use 4 • Rework 18 • • • Shipping 24 • • • Sifting of dried egg products 21 • • Spray/pan drying (yellow/white) 16 • Storage, handling and loading of egg product after packaging and prior to shipping 23 • • • 2', 'Suggested General Verification Questions for Most Process Steps Thefollowingset of general questions should beused by FSIS personnelwhen evaluating and assessing the adequacy of a plant’s hazard analysis and its decision making for each process step relative to potential hazards, controls for identified hazards, monitoring and recordkeeping. This Guide also includes more specific questionsfor each process step under the Process Steps, Potential Hazards, and Frequently Used Controls section that FSIS personnel can use to assist with their evaluation of the adequacy of a plant’s HACCP system. • Has the plant included this process step in its flow chart and hazard analysis? • Does the plant have a prerequisite program that addresses this process step? • Has theplantidentified any hazards associated with thisprocessstep? • Is this process step a CCP? • Is theplantfollowing procedures to eliminate or reduce any identified hazard? • Can the plant support that the hazard is not reasonably likely to occur (NRLTO)? • Did the plant validate the control methods, including preventive measures and prerequisite programs, for this hazard? • Does the plant have in-plant validation data for 90 calendar days to support that the control is working as intended? (NOTE: The documentation for in-plant validation from small and very small establishments may contain data from greater than 90 calendar days if a request is granted in writing by thedistrict officefor additional calendar days to gather records to cover at least 13 production days.) • Is the plant following all procedures (i.e., prerequisite or other programs) identified in its hazard analysis? • Does the plant maintain records associated with this process step? • Do records contain information that indicates a reassessment of thehazard analysisis necessary? • Are records made available to FSIS? • Is the equipment used clean, sanitary, and well maintained? 3', 'Process Steps, Potential Hazards, and Frequently Used Controls Process Step Potential Hazards Frequently Used Controls Receiving and storage of shell eggs prior to use Note: Shells eggs intended for breakingmust be transported and stored at or below 45°F ambient temperature beginning 36 hours a fter time of la y (21 CFR 118.4(e)).
