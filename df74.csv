The CCA is a country’s national government authority that is responsible for ensuring the safety and truthful labeling of the food supply. This guideline provides information about the: - Background on the US equivalence process within the context of the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures and the World Trade Organization; - Information on the different types of equivalence determinations; and - The steps that countries are to follow to obtain an equivalence determination from FSIS. What is Equivalence? Equivalence is the process of determining whether a country’s food safety inspection system achieves FSIS’s appropriate level of protection for public health as applied domestically in the US. Additionally, the country’s food safety inspection system is to provide standards equivalent to FSIS to ensure other non-food safety requirements (such as humane handling, accurate labeling, and assurance that meat, poultry, or egg products are not economically adulterated) are met. This means that the country is not required to develop and implement the same procedures that the US does, but rather the country must objectively demonstrate how its procedures meets the US level of protection. Countries wishing to become eligible to export meat, poultry, or egg products to the US must demonstrate that they have a regulatory food safety inspection system that is equivalent to that of the US. The following is an example of when FSIS determined that a country’s raw beef products inspection system was equivalent and the country’s food safety procedures were different that the US procedures. Example of an Equivalent Food Safety Procedure Different from FSIS FSIS has a food safety objective-based criterion that requires the CCA to ensure that raw beef products are free of shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) at the end Key Point Equivalence is the process of determining whether a country’s food safety inspection system achieves FSIS’s appropriate level of public health protection as applied domestically in the US.', '2 of the production process. In the US, beef slaughter and processing establishments use a combination of antimicrobial treatments and sanitary dressing procedures to control STEC. However, other countries prohibit the use of antimicrobial treatments and have submitted requirements that raw beef establishments are to implement robust sanitary dressing procedures with additional controls and government verification procedures to prevent STEC. In this situation, the CCA has verification procedures (including rigorous microbial sampling) that demonstrate sanitary dressing procedures ensure that raw beef products are free of STEC at the end of the production process. Additionally, the CCA’s controls include a focus on carcasses as well as other conditions (high event periods) and classes of raw products that collectively increase the likelihood of detecting STEC if present. Based upon the evaluation of the CCA’s verification procedures, controls, and receipt and evaluation of ongoing microbial results from the CCA, FSIS has determined this approach to be equivalent because the CCA demonstrates that it meets the food safety criterion. Equivalence Background Determining equivalence of a country’s food safety inspection system is important because it protects public health and facilitates trade. An equivalence determination of an exporting country’s regulatory food safety inspection system for meat, poultry, or egg products is a prerequisite for trade for the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). USDA-FSIS is the US CCA responsible for regulating and inspecting meat, poultry, and egg products. FSIS implements an equivalence process to ensure that US treaty obligations under the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement) is met. The SPS Agreement sets out the basic international rules for food safety, animal, and plant health standards. FSIS ensures during the equivalence process that the following SPS Agreement standards are met through the implementation of the following principles: science, risk assessments, transparency, harmonization, and equivalence. To ensure that meat, poultry, or egg products (including imported products) do not pose any public health risks to US consumers, FSIS implements the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA), Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA), Egg Products Inspection Act (EPIA), Humane Methods of Slaughter Act (HMSA), and regulations under Title 9 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 300-590. FSIS ensures that a country’s food safety inspection system addresses FSIS’s food safety regulatory-based objectives. Food safety regulatory-based objectives are food safety goals for preventing the occurrence of an identified food safety hazard. The criteria by which FSIS assesses the equivalence of a country’s food safety inspection system can be found under Title 9 CFR §327.2 (for meat products), §557.2 (for fish of the order Siluriformes products), §381.196 (for poultry products), and §590.910 (for egg products).', ""3 Types of Equivalence Determinations There are four (4) types of equivalence determinations: (1) Initial Equivalence, (2) Ongoing Equivalence Verification, (3) Reinstatement of Equivalence, and (4) Individual Sanitary Measure. How to Start the Equivalence Process Countries wishing to export meat, poultry, or egg products to the US for the first time are to have their CCA contact FSIS’s Office of International Coordination (OIC) by submitting a formal written to request an initial equivalence determination. In response to a country’s request, FSIS will provide the country a packet of information that includes guidance and a Self-Reporting Tool (SRT). The SRT is a questionnaire that provides an organized means for the country’s government to demonstrate that its inspection system achieves an equivalent level of protection as applied domestically in the US. The SRT is arranged into six components: •Explanation About the Type of Equivalence Determination Types of Equivalence Determinations •For countries seeking to export meat, poultry, or egg products to the US for the first time •FSIS evaluates a country's food safety inspection system to make an inital equivalence determination before the country can export products to the US. •Rulemaking is only required for initial equivalence determinations. (1) Initial Equivalence •For countries that have an equivalence determination and are exporting meat, poultry, or egg products to the US •Countries are to maintain communication with the US concerning updates to their food safety inspection system. (2) Ongoing Equivalence Verification •For countries that FSIS has determined to have an equivalent food safety inspection system and stopped exporting to the US for an extended period of time •FSIS will reassess the food safety inspection system before the country can export products to the US again. (3) Reinstatement of Equivalence •For countries that have an equivalence determination and want to change a procedure in their food safety inspection system •FSIS will assess the new procedure before the country can implement the procedure for products it exports to the US. (4) Individual Sanitary Measure"", '4 1. Government Oversight (e.g., Organization and Administration) 2. Government Statutory Authority and Food Safety and Other Consumer Protection Regulations (e.g., Inspection System Operation, Product Standards and Labeling, and Humane Handling) 3. Government Sanitation 4. Government Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) System 5. Government Chemical Residues Testing Programs 6. Government Microbiological Testing Programs NOTE: Please refer to the Self-Reporting Tool (SRT) for additional information on how a country should categorize its food safety inspection system and respond to the SRT. Countries wishing to (1) reinstate previous equivalence determinations to start exporting meat, poultry, or egg products to the US again, or (2) change a procedure (sanitary measure) that the US has previously determined to be equivalent in their food safety inspection system are to submit a formal written request to OIC. A possible reason for a country to request a reinstatement of equivalence determination includes the lifting of a trade ban after an extended period of time due to a change in animal disease status allowing the export of certain animal products to the US. An example of an individual sanitary measure equivalence determination request is when a country wants to change its postmortem inspection procedures for livestock from traditional (hands-on) inspection to a visual assessment. NOTE: Reinstatement and individual sanitary measure equivalence determination requests are only applicable to countries that have received an initial equivalence determination of their food safety inspection system for meat, poultry, or egg products. Written requests must clarify the type of equivalence determination (for example, initial, reinstatement, or individual sanitary measure), as well as the commodity the request is for. Some examples of requests include: reinstatement of equivalence for raw beef, or initial equivalence for heat-treated and thermally processed poultry. Please submit all written equivalence requests to: United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service Office of International Coordination 1400 Independence Avenue, SW Room 3143, South Building Washington, DC 20250 Phone: (202) 708-9543 Fax: (202) 690-3856', '5 E-mail: InternationalCoordination@fsis.usda.gov Letters can be transmitted by e-mail (preferred), mail, or fax. Initial Equivalence Process An initial equivalence determination by FSIS of a country’s meat, poultry, or egg products food safety inspection system is a prerequisite for trade with the US. The FMIA, PPIA, and EPIA require FSIS to establish the equivalence of a country’s food safety inspection system before accepting meat, poultry, or egg products from the exporting country for sale in US commerce. To establish equivalence, FSIS assesses a country’s food safety inspection system through the country’s responses to the SRT, including a review of supporting documentation (for example, food safety legislation, policies, and annexes) that the country provides to support its answers in the SRT, and through an on-site verification audit. The following six (6) steps briefly outline the initial equivalence process for a country wishing to secure an initial equivalence determination to export meat, poultry, or egg products to the US for the first time. Step 1 – Country Submits Written Request to FSIS Any country can request eligibility to export meat, poultry, or egg products to the US. The eligibility process begins with a formal written request submitted to FSIS’s OIC. For more information on submitting a formal written request, please refer to subsection “How to Start the Equivalence Process,” under the “Types of Equivalence Determinations” section. Step 2 – Document Submission Through a Self-Reporting Tool In response to a country’s request for equivalence, FSIS will provide the country a packet of information that includes guidance and the SRT. NOTE: Please refer to the Self-Reporting Tool (SRT) for additional information on how a country should categorize their food safety inspection system and respond to the SRT. Initial Equivalence Process 1. Country Submits Written Request to FSIS 2. Document Submission Through Self-Reporting Tool 3. Document Review 4. On-site Verification Audit 5. Public Notification-Proposed Rule in Federal Register 6. Final Determination of Equivalence-Final Rule in Federal Register;', '6 A country can submit a complete SRT by mail, electronic mail, or through FSIS’s Public Health Inspection System (PHIS). PHIS is FSIS’s web-based database that countries can access to complete an SRT and upload supporting documentation. The benefits of using PHIS to submit the information include an expedited SRT review, transparency, and security. To ensure an expedited review of a submitted SRT, particularly an SRT submitted in PHIS, FSIS encourages countries to submit SRT responses and supporting documentation in English. Countries are to contact FSIS’s OIC for: • Questions and requests for technical assistance; • To submit a completed SRT and referenced supporting documentation in paper or electronically in Microsoft Word for FSIS’s review ; or • To notify FSIS that an SRT has been submitted through PHIS. NOTE: Please refer to FSIS’s guide on Steps to Obtain Level 2 eAuthentication Credentials and PHIS Access for additional information on how to get access to PHIS. Please also refer to FSIS’s presentation on How to Complete and Submit the SRT Using PHIS for additional information on how to complete and submit an SRT through FSIS’s PHIS. Step 3 –Document Review After FSIS receives an SRT with all referenced supporting documentation, FSIS reviews the information to determine whether the country’s documented food safety inspection system appears equivalent. If FSIS needs further information or clarification, OIC will advise the country’s CCA of data, programs, or other information that the CCA needs to provide FSIS. If a country submits SRT responses with supporting documentation in a language other than English, FSIS will: 1. Send the documentation for translation into English, and place translated English responses into the SRT in PHIS. This provides the CCA the opportunity to verify the accuracy of the English-translated SRT responses and documents. 2. FSIS, using food safety objective-based criteria, will then review the SRT responses and supporting documentation to determine whether the country’s documented food safety inspection system appears equivalent. 3. After FSIS completes its review, FSIS will send any questions requiring clarification to the CCA, or inform the CCA that its documented food safety inspection appears equivalent and advise on next steps. Key Point FSIS encourages countries to submit SRT responses and supporting documentation in English through PHIS to expedite the review process.', '7 IMPORTANT: Submitting SRT answers and documents in languages other than English will significantly delay FSIS’s review process of the SRT. The translation process may take several months. To facilitate an efficient review of an SRT and supporting documentation, particularly an SRT submitted in PHIS, FSIS strongly encourages that countries submit their SRT responses and supporting documentation in English. NOTE: FSIS will accept SRT responses and supporting documentation submitted in any of the three (3) official languages of the WTO: English, French, or Spanish. Step 4 –On-Site Verification Audit An on-site verification audit is an audit of the country’s food safety inspection system with the goal of verifying, through objective evidence, that the country’s inspection system has an equivalent level of public health protection as applied domestically in the US. If FSIS determines that a country’s food safety inspection system is tentatively equivalent based on the SRT document review process, OIC will work with the country’s CCA to arrange an on-site verification audit of the country’s food safety inspection system. Initial equivalence audits are conducted by FSIS International Auditors. The audit scope includes visual observations of all aspects of the country’s food safety inspection system and may include the following: • Review of the country’s laws, regulations, directives, notices, and other program implementation documents; • Review of records of potential exporting establishments’ operations, inspection results, and enforcement activities; • Review of the government chemical residue testing program; • Review of government microbiological testing programs; • Review of third party audit reports; and • Review of other US import requirements, such as pathogen reduction and HACCP system programs. During the on-site audit, International Auditors verify that the CCA implements, monitors, and verifies all of the procedures in the country’s food safety inspection system. Typically, International Auditors will need to visit multiple sites that may include the following: • Central, regional, and local government offices; • Potential exporting establishments (slaughter and processing establishments) and warehouses (including cold storage); and • Laboratories.', '8 After the on-site audit, FSIS sends a draft audit report to the country applying for equivalence for the country’s review and comment. FSIS then takes the country’s comments into account and generates the final audit report. Step 5 – Public Notification - Proposed Rule in a Federal Register Based on the outcome of FSIS’s SRT and supporting documentation review and the onsite audit, FSIS initiates rulemaking to propose that the country be listed in the CFR as eligible to export meat, poultry, or egg products to the US. To initiate rulemaking, the country will need to provide 5 years of projected economic analysis information. Upon publication, the public can submit comments (generally up to 60 days after publication) to FSIS about the proposed rule. Step 6 – Final Determination of Equivalence - Final Rule in Federal Register FSIS analyzes any received comments and publishes a final rule to list the country in the CFR as eligible to export meat, poultry, or egg products to the US. FSIS sends the country a letter notifying it of the published rule. The letter includes instructions about exporting meat, poultry, or egg products to the US. After the rule becomes effective, the country then certifies establishments as being eligible to export meat, poultry, or egg products to the US. After a country has compiled a list of eligible certified establishments, the country sends the completed list to OIC. A certified establishment is an establishment that the CCA determines as meeting US requirements and, therefore, eligible to export meat, poultry, or egg products to the US. NOTE: Equivalent countries are required to notify FSIS when there are changes in the eligibility of certified establishments, and must confirm with FSIS at least annually (by May 18th), after FSIS determines the country’s food safety inspection system to be equivalent, all certified establishments eligible to export to the US. Additionally, countries are to submit to OIC a sample of the health certificate they propose to use for exported meat, poultry, or egg product shipments to the US. Each eligible country’s CCA is responsible for the certification of shipments of meat, poultry, or egg products to the US. Please refer to Title 9 CFR §327.4 (for meat), §557.4 (for fish of the order Siluriformes products), §381.197 (for poultry), and §590.915 (for egg products). Please see FSIS Directive 9770.1, Determining the Initial Equivalence of Foreign Food Safety Systems, for additional information on how FSIS personnel make initial equivalence determinations. Animal Health Considerations It is important to note that FSIS only determines whether a country’s meat, poultry, or egg products food safety inspection system is equivalent. Countries should be aware that animal diseases are regulated by the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection', '9 Document Reviews On-Site Audits Point-of-Entry Reinspection Service (APHIS) (Title 9 CFR Parts 92 through 95), and a country’s animal disease status can impact what products the country can export to the US. For a list of USDArecognized animal health status of countries, please visit APHIS’s Animal Disease Status webpage (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-andanimal-product-import-information/ct_animal_disease_status). FSIS recommends that countries work with both FSIS and APHIS to address each Agency’s eligibility requirements to successfully export meat, poultry, or egg products to the US. If countries have questions or require further information related to imports of animal products or by-products, please contact APHIS’s National Center for Import and Export at: USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Veterinary Services (VS) National Center for Import and Export 4700 River Road, Riverdale, MD 20737 Phone: (301) 851-3300, option 1 E-mail: AskNIES.Products@aphis.usda.gov Ongoing Equivalence Verification Determination Process FSIS will continuously evaluate and verify the equivalency of an exporting country’s food safety inspection system through a three (3) part process: (1) document reviews, (2) on-site audits, and (3) point-of-entry reinspection of meat, poultry, and egg products. Part 1 – Document Reviews Countries are to submit the following for review at least annually by May 18th: 1. Either (1) updated SRT responses, or (2) communicate to FSIS that the CCA has verified its SRT responses, as recorded in PHIS (i.e., by reviewing the SRT electronically in PHIS) or by mailed hard copy of the version of SRT responses FSIS has entered for the CCA, are accurate and complete. 2. An up-to-date list of all certified establishments eligible to export meat, poultry, or egg products the US. 3. An updated government residue control program, including the previous year’s residue test results and reactions to residue findings.', '10 4. Updated government microbiological sampling and testing programs, including the previous year’s test results and reactions to: (A) indicator organism results for intestinal or fecal contamination; (B) Salmonella and Campylobacter results for raw meat and poultry products; (C) Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, or other pathogens of public health concern in ready-to-eat (RTE) meat and poultry products and all lots of pasteurized egg products; and (D) STEC in raw beef products. Part 2 – On-Site Audits FSIS will periodically conduct an on-site audit of every eligible country’s food safety inspection system. These audits will be performed by FSIS International Auditors and are similar to the on-site verification audits that FSIS does as part of the initial equivalence process. If a country has implemented any new individual sanitary measures since the previous audit, International Auditors will verify that the CCA is implementing the procedures as described in the submitted documentation for the individual sanitary measure that FSIS found equivalent. In addition, if a country has received multiple point-of-entry reinspection violations, the International Auditors may need to visit those certified establishments with the violations during the audit to determine whether there is a breakdown in the implementation of the country’s food safety inspection system. Please refer to Part 3 below for more information on point-of-entry reinspection. In addition, please refer to Step 4 subsection under the “Initial Equivalence Process” section for additional information about on-site audits performed by International Auditors. Part 3 – Point-of-Entry Reinspection All imported shipments of meat, poultry, and egg products that enter the US are presented to FSIS for reinspection. FSIS has import inspection facilities located across the US at major ocean ports and land border crossings. At these import inspection facilities, FSIS checks every shipment for eligibility, certification, transportation damage, and labeling. The purpose of point-of-entry reinspection is to monitor the effectiveness of an eligible exporting country’s food safety inspection system, not to assess the performance of an individual certified establishment. In addition to point-of-entry shipment reinspection, FSIS performs more detailed, random reinspection activities on select lots within received shipments of meat, poultry, and egg products. These reinspection activities may include physical product examinations, condition-of-container reinspection, and laboratory sampling. Imported meat, poultry, and egg products determined to meet FSIS import requirements are stamped as “Inspected and Passed,” and the products are released into US commerce. Non-compliant products are marked as “Refused Entry,” and FSIS notifies the Importer of Record that the products are prohibited from entering US commerce.', '11 Please see FSIS Directive 9780.1, Verifying the Ongoing Equivalence of Foreign Food Safety Systems, for additional information on how FSIS personnel verify the ongoing equivalence of foreign countries’ food safety inspection systems. Please see FSIS Directive 9900.2, Import Reinspection of Meat, Poultry, and Egg Products, for additional information on FSIS’s reinspection procedures. Reinstatement of Equivalence Process A reinstatement of equivalence process is undertaken when a country wants to start exporting meat, poultry, or egg products again to the US. A country requests a reinstatement of equivalence determination for a specific commodity (for example, raw beef) after a long period of trade inactivity. The trade inactivity is typically due to the implementation of a trade ban preventing the exportation of certain animal products to the US due to a country’s animal disease status. A reinstatement of equivalence process follows the same process as the initial equivalence process, except that the country may be subjected to a verification audit, and will not be subjected to the rulemaking steps. The rulemaking steps are not applicable for a reinstatement of equivalence determination because the country’s food safety inspection system has already been determined to be equivalent. The following five (5) steps briefly outline the process for reinstating equivalence: Please refer to Steps 1 through 4 under the “Initial Equivalence Process” subsections for additional information. After FSIS completes its document review and, as needed, an on-site verification audit, OIC will notify the country of FSIS’s decision through a formal written letter. The letter will discuss FSIS’s basis for its decision to reinstate equivalence. If FSIS does not perform an audit as part of the reinstatement of equivalence process, then FSIS will verify the reinstated process during the next scheduled audit. Please see FSIS Directive 9770.1, Determining the Initial Equivalence of Foreign Food Safety Systems, for additional information on how FSIS personnel make reinstatement of equivalence determinations. Reinstatement of Equivalence Process 1. Country submits written request to FSIS 2. Document submission through Self-Reporting Tool 3. Document review 4. On-site verification audit (may or may not be needed) 5. FSIS notifies country of equivalence determination through a formal written letter (no rulemaking is necessary)', '12 Individual Sanitary Measure Equivalence Process Eligible countries currently exporting meat, poultry, or egg products to the US request an individual sanitary measure when they want to change a procedure in their food safety inspection system. An eligible country is to request an individual sanitary measure equivalence determination before the country implements the new procedure on products destined for export to the US. Countries are to submit a formal written request for an individual sanitary measure to FSIS’s OIC. If a country does not notify FSIS of changes in its food safety procedures, a possible disruption of trade could result. FSIS will evaluate a request for an individual sanitary measure equivalence determination to ensure that the new procedure: • Is equivalent to FSIS’s relevant food safety regulatory objective-based criteria, and • Achieves an appropriate level of protection from identified food safety hazards. There are two (2) reasons an eligible country requests an individual sanitary measure equivalence determination. 1. The country wants to make a change to a procedure in its food safety inspection system that FSIS previously determined was equivalent. 2. FSIS has updated its US domestic food safety procedures or requirements and identified that the procedures or requirements affect previous equivalence determinations for specific eligible countries. If FSIS determines that eligible countries may be affected by a change in US domestic procedures or requirements, OIC provides notice through the WTO and directly communicates to all countries exporting meat, poultry, or egg products to the US. After FSIS publishes the procedures or requirements as part of final rulemaking through a Federal Register Notice, they become an import requirement. The following five (5) steps briefly summarize the individual sanitary measure equivalence process: Please refer to Steps 1 through 3 under the “Initial Equivalence Process” subsections for additional information. Individual Sanitary Measure Equivalence Process 1. Country submits written request to FSIS 2. Document submission through Self-Reporting Tool 3. Document review 4. FSIS notifies country of its individual sanitary measure equivalence determination through a formal written letter.', '13 Countries that request an individual sanitary measure will need to update their SRT and submit supporting documentation to FSIS for review. The submitted documentation should demonstrate that the measure provides an equivalent level of public health protection. After FSIS completes its review, OIC will notify the country of FSIS’s decision through a formal written letter. The letter will discuss FSIS’s basis for its decision to either accept or reject the proposed individual sanitary measure. If FSIS accepts the individual sanitary measure, FSIS will verify the application of the individual sanitary measure during the next scheduled on-site verification audit. Whom to Contact for Questions or Request Additional Information Countries are to contact FSIS’s OIC for: 1. All questions and requests for technical assistance, 2. To submit formal equivalence requests, 3. To submit a paper copy of an SRT and supporting documentation for review, or 4. To notify FSIS that an SRT was submitted in PHIS.
