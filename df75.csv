The standard does not require the States operate their MPI programs in a manner that is the same as or identical to FSIS’s inspection program, nor does it prohibit the State MPI programs from establishing safeguards they believe to be more effective than those employed by FSIS. KEY DEFINITION AND STATE MPI PROGRAM REQUIREMENT “At Least Equal To” Page 4', 'I. PURPOSE This guideline provides information to State Cooperative Inspection programs on the criteria that the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) uses to determine each year whether State Meat and Poultry Inspection (MPI) programs are operating verifiably in accordance with requirements that are “at least equal to” the Federal inspection requirements. The guideline contains information that State MPI programs need to establish and maintain such programs. II. BACKGROUND The Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 661) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) (21 U.S.C. 454) authorize FSIS to cooperate with State agencies in developing and administering their own Meat and Poultry Inspection (MPI) programs. Individual State MPI programs are required to operate under authorities that are “at least equal to” the provisions for ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection, reinspection, sanitation, recordkeeping, and enforcement in the FMIA and PPIA and implementing regulations. State MPI programs are also expected to ensure livestock are treated humanely by assuring the methods of handling livestock are “at least equal to” those outlined in the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act of 1978 (HMSA)(7 U.S.C. 1901-906). The FMIA (21 U.S.C. 661(b)) and the PPIA (21 U.S.C. 454 (b)) authorize FSIS to cooperate with a single State agency and subordinate governmental unit primarily responsible for the coordination of a State MPI program. In matters concerning the State MPI program, FSIS will communicate and coordinate with designated State employees assigned to the single State agency identified by the State as responsible for ensuring that all applicable inspection and compliance activities outlined in these guidelines comply with specified laws, regulations and policies. The activities include those conducted by State or contract laboratories, public health departments, law enforcement agencies, State human resource departments, budget departments and other State regulatory agencies. This guideline replaces the previous version, issued July 2008. FSIS updated the guideline to consolidate components, add new components and resource information, and to revise tables. The most notable changes are as follows: The date for the States’ annual self-assessment submission has changed from November 15th to November 1st of each year. Component 1 - Statutory Authority and Food Safety Regulations has a new table titled “Statutory Side-by-Side Comparison Table” Component 2 - Inspection includes: • Former Component 6 – Non- Food Safety Consumer Protection is added in its entirety; • The Quarterly New Issuance Review process is a new section added to this component; and • The guideline titled, “At least equal to data system requirements for State Cooperative Meat and Poultry Inspection (MPI) programs electing not to use FSIS’s Public Health Information System (PHIS)” published in January 2015 is added at the end of Component 2. Component 3 – Sampling Programs (formerly known as “Product Sampling”) has been retitled. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES Page 5', 'III. ANNUAL SELF-ASSESSMENT FSIS expects the State MPI programs to submit their annual self-assessment documents to FSIS’s FederalState Audit Branch (FSAB) on or before November 1st of each year. Each State MPI program should start its annual self-assessment with a review of the prior-year selfassessment. Each component of the annual selfassessment should include a written narrative statement and documentation demonstrating the program continuously meets the criteria to be “at least equal to” the Federal program. The self-assessment should identify any program changes in the previous 12 months and include documentation which will support the State’s ability to maintain its program for the next 12 months. State MPI programs should also submit sufficient documentation to demonstrate the State MPI program has stayed current with FSIS statutes, regulations, applicable FSIS Directives and Notices, and has implemented any changes necessary to maintain its “at least equal to” status. The annual self-assessment submission should also include one or more narratives describing internal controls used by the State MPI program that: • Provide assurances that internal controls can measure the effectiveness of the program under the “at least equal to” criteria; • Demonstrate how nonconformances will be addressed by corrective actions; and • Demonstrate how the State MPI program will be maintained throughout the next 12 months. These internal controls should provide an objective assessment of the State MPI program’s operations and processes to determine whether: • Financial and operating information is accurate and reliable; • Operational risks are appropriately identified and managed; • Applicable regulations and internal policies and procedures are followed; and • The “at least equal to” standard is maintained. Component 6 – Compliance (formerly known as “Component 7 – Compliance”) has been retitled and includes a new table titled “Summary of Statutory Authority per Business Type.” Component 7 – Laboratory Methods and Quality Assurance Program is a new component for laboratory methods and quality assurance criteria. This information was previously published in June 2014 as a separate guideline titled “At Least Equal To Compliance Guideline for State Meat and Poultry Inspection (MPI) Programs for Laboratory Methods” and has been updated and added as a component. The following Tables have been updated to better reflect the information needed by FSIS in the evaluation of State MPI program operations: Component 3 – State MPI Program Sampling Activity Table. Component 4 – State MPI Program Establishment Count and the State MPI Program Employee Primary Roles. Component 6 – Compliance Activity Report. Additional Resources is a new section added at the end of the guideline to provide State MPI program Directors with reference material that may be needed to perform business processes related to budget submissions, training and Federal resource information, cooperation between State and Federal Compliance programs, and information on internal controls. The section also includes a Reference Table of Related FSIS Policy Documents, which is a reference guide to FSIS policy documents relevant to the implementation of the nine program components. Page 6', 'Ultimately, State MPI programs need to operate in a manner that protects the health and welfare of consumers within their State by ensuring the meat and poultry products distributed by the program establishments are wholesome, not adulterated, and properly marked, labeled, and packaged. More specifically, the annual self-assessment should also address each of the following nine program components so as to demonstrate the State’s MPI program is administered in a manner that is “at least equal to” the Federal inspection requirements and describe how it will maintain this status for the following 12 months. FSIS Directive 5720.3, Methodology for Performing Scheduled and Targeted Reviews of State Meat and Poultry Inspection Programs, provides the FSIS review methodology and criteria for each component. For each of the first six (1-6) components, State MPI programs need to submit selfassessment documentation demonstrating the State MPI program is meeting the “at least equal to” Federal inspection requirements. Such documentation should include the attached Annual Certification – “At Least Equal To” Meat and Poultry Inspection Program (Attachment 1, page 10) and a narrative describing any changes made in the State MPI program during the previous 12 months. For Component 2, State MPI programs that have elected not to use the FSIS Public Health Information System (PHIS), should refer to guidance information (Attachment 3, Component 1 Statutory Authority and Food Safety Regulations Component 2 Inspection Component 3 Sampling Programs Component 4 Staffing, Training, and Supervision Component 5 Humane Handling Component 6 Compliance Component 7 Laboratory Methods and Quality Assurance Program Component 8 Civil Rights Component 9 Financial Accountability The Nine Program Components Page 7', 'page 38) titled, “At least equal to” data system guidance for State Cooperative Meat and Poultry Inspection (MPI) programs electing not to use Public Health Information System (PHIS) can be found at the end of Component 2. State MPI program Directors are to submit the requested data system information with the annual self-assessment submission to FSAB for review. For Component 7, State MPI programs need to submit the following self-assessment documentation to FSIS, Office of Public Health Science (OPHS): • A list of current State laboratory and/or contract laboratory test methods and copies of new or revised methods accompanied by a Laboratory Method Notification Form; and • A completed FSIS Form 5720-14, FSIS MPI Program Laboratory Quality Management System Checklist or use another easy to read format for each State or contract laboratory performing MPI-related analyses or their current ISO 17025 certificates of accreditation for each State and/or contract laboratory performing MPI-related analyses For Component 8, the State MPI programs are to complete and submit FSIS Form 1520-1, Civil Rights Compliance of State-Inspection Programs, or use another easy to read format to the FSIS Civil Rights Staff. Relative to Component 9, the State MPI programs should submit specified financial reports as requested throughout the fiscal year. Although deadlines for submitting certain financial reports may coincide with FSIS’s self-assessment submission deadline of November 1. Financial Reviews and Analysis Section (FRAS) does not require the inclusion of these financial reports as part of the annual self-assessment submission for Component 9. Component 9 includes a list of supporting documentation the State agencies should have readily available for FSIS reviewers, upon request, prior to or during the on-site financial review. State MPI program Directors should submit the self-assessment for the various program components and any required or requested documents as follows: Components 1–6 Email: StateMPIProgramSubmissions@fsis.usda.gov USDA, FSIS, OIEA, MCAD, FSAB Chief Edward Zorinsky Federal Building 1616 Capital Avenue, Suite 260 Omaha, NE 68102-5908 Telephone: 402-344-5018 Fax: 402-344-5104 Page 8', 'Component 7 Email: Statelabinquiry@fsis.usda.gov Director, USDA, FSIS, OPHS, Laboratory Quality Assurance Staff 950 College Station Road Athens, GA 30605 Telephone: 706-546-3559 Component 8 FSIS Civil Rights Staff 5601 Sunnyside Avenue, Mail Drop 5261 Beltsville, MD 20705-5261 Telephone: 800-269-6912 Fax: 301-504-2141 Component 9 Email: FRAS@fsis.usda.gov Financial Reviews and Analysis Section USDA/FSIS/OA/OCFO/FMD/FASMB 5601 Sunnyside Avenue, Mail Drop 5264 Beltsville, MD 20705-5264 Telephone: 301-344-0479 Fax: 301-504-5914 Page 9', 'Attachment 1 Annual Certification “At Least Equal To” Meat and Poultry Inspection Program I have reviewed the attached self-assessment submission of the [insert name of State] State-Federal Cooperative Inspection program.

ON-SITE REVIEW In addition to the annual self-assessment submission, State MPI programs are subject to an on-site review at a minimum frequency of once every three years to verify the accuracy and implementation of the self-assessment submissions. In the year that a State MPI program is scheduled for an on-site review, FSIS’s annual determination of whether the program is “at least equal to” the Federal inspection program will be based on a review of the annual self-assessment submission and the on-site review. Please refer to FSIS Directive 5720.3, Methodology for Performing Scheduled and Targeted Reviews of State Meat and Poultry Inspection Programs, for the FSIS Review Methodology. The purpose of the on-site review is for FSIS to verify the State MPI program implements and maintains its inspection system in accordance with its annually submitted self-assessment, and to determine whether the State MPI program is “at least equal to” the Federal inspection program in its administration and enforcement of requirements. The FSIS review team will review the State MPI program’s current annual self-assessment submission in advance so that they are able to begin the on-site review of the State MPI program with a thorough understanding of the State program’s current self-assessment submission. FSIS will review a selected number of establishments within the State MPI program and examine and evaluate documentation at the central office to verify the State MPI program’s implementation, oversight, and management controls. In October of each year, FSIS will announce the State MPI programs scheduled for an on-site review in the upcoming federal fiscal year. FSIS will send a written notification to State MPI programs at least 30 days before the start of the on-site review process. The on-site review will begin with a teleconference serving as the entrance meeting between FSIS and State MPI program officials. To facilitate FSIS’s selection of establishments to review, State MPI program officials are to supply information from the last 12 months (12 months prior to review) to FSIS within 10 business days after the conclusion of the entrance meeting. The information is to include the following: • A current list of establishments and their operating schedules (please omit ID warehouses and establishments which slaughter or process only non-amenable species), supervisory boundaries, program updates, and HACCP process categories for all establishments with the 5 highest producers for each category identified. • Positive Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) results • Positive Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) or Salmonella results in RTE products • Failures of Salmonella and Campylobacter Performance Standards for raw products • Enforcement actions taken • Recalls conducted and associated documentation', '• Establishments that sustained structural damage in production areas due to natural disasters • Establishments that the State MPI program reviewed, e.g., FSAs, supervisory reviews, internal reviews, management control audits At least one week before the scheduled on-site review, FSIS will notify the State MPI program of the establishments chosen for the on-site review. Should the State MPI program officials ask FSIS to omit a chosen State establishment from its review, they will need to provide written justification for their request (e.g., the establishment is closed the day of the review, the establishment is a seasonal operator). FSIS travels to the chosen State establishment and follows the on-site review protocol. If a chosen State establishment decides not to operate after the on-site review process begins, FSIS selects an alternate State establishment to visit. An electronic draft report of individual establishment findings will be provided to the State MPI program officials by the next business day. At the end of each establishment review, after a short correlation with FSIS, the State MPI program personnel will lead an exit meeting with State establishment management. Within 10 working days of completing the on-site review, FSAB will schedule a teleconference exit meeting with State MPI program officials. Before the teleconference exit meeting, FSAB will provide a summary report of all findings to the State MPI program officials. The types of findings detailed in the aforementioned FSAB summary report that requires corrective actions will include: • Processes that are not operating or functioning in the manner intended as detailed in the State’s annual self-assessment or that are not included in the self-assessment submission; • Processes that are ineffective; and • Regulatory noncompliances. The State MPI program has 10 working days after the teleconference to present an action plan designed to address all findings that require corrective actions. The State MPI program is to identify any underlying causes for findings that require corrective actions. Corrective actions may include the implementation of preventive measures e.g., targeted staff training, increased supervisory oversight, where applicable. If the State MPI program is unable to identify underlying causes for certain findings they are to share and explain the method they used in their attempts to identify the underlying causes and the results of the associated evaluation conducted to draw the conclusion. They are to also justify why they believe the corrective actions identified in the action plan for such findings are adequate. After receiving documentation demonstrating implementation of the action plan, FSAB will assess the plan and determine if actions taken are sufficient. If the action plan is adequate FSAB will issue a determination Page 12', 'memorandum and Interim Annual Comprehensive Review and Determination Report to the State MPI program Director. FSIS may request clarification of specific items regarding the State MPI program’s implementation of its action plan, and in certain cases, may perform a targeted on-site review before the issuance of a determination memorandum. A targeted on-site review conducted prior to the issuance of a determination memorandum is an in-depth evaluation of the State MPI program’s implementation of its action plan. FSIS uses the targeted review to verify resolution of any public health concerns and compliance with the “at least equal to” criteria. The Annual Comprehensive Review and Determination Report will summarize the results of the State’s self-assessment submission and on-site review of the State MPI program (including the results of the targeted on-site review, if applicable). The report will include the FSIS review team’s final “at least equal to” determination supported by individual component determinations. V. DETERMINATION PROCESS FSIS makes a determination after evaluating the State’s annual self-assessment and the results of the on-site review, as applicable. The definitions for the three FSIS determinations on the status of the State MPI program are: 1. “At Least Equal To”—The State MPI program has adopted laws, regulations, and programs, and implements them in a manner that is “at least equal to” FSIS’s Federal inspection program for all review components. 2. “At Least Equal To,” with Provisions—FSIS makes a provisional determination of the State MPI program’s “at least equal to,” status provided the program takes additional action to resolve review findings. 3. Not “At Least Equal To”—The State MPI program has not adopted laws, regulations, or programs, or does not implement them in a manner that is “at least equal to” FSIS’s Federal inspection program for one or more of the review components. At the conclusion of each annual self-assessment review, FSIS decides whether the State MPI program is or is not meeting the “at least equal to” requirements. If the State MPI program is not scheduled for an on-site review during the current fiscal year, FSIS makes an annual determination based only on the results of the self-assessment review. If the State MPI program is scheduled for an on-site review during the current fiscal year, FSIS bases the annual determination on the results of the self-assessment and the on-site review. If the determination of the self-assessment, or self-assessment and the on-site review, if applicable, is that the State program meets the “at least equal to” standard, FSIS promptly gives the State program officials written notification of that Page 13', 'fact. If additional clarification is needed for a determination, FSIS requests supplemental information from the State MPI program and issues an Interim Annual Comprehensive Review and Determination Report. When an analysis of all findings, clarifications, and corrective actions from the selfassessment or on-site review indicates a State MPI program cannot support an “at least equal to” determination, FSIS recommends to the Secretary of Agriculture that the State be designated for Federal inspection.1 If a State cannot immediately implement an action plan but is committed to making the corrections and has the resources to support the changes, FSIS defers designation instead of making a final determination that the State program is not “at least equal to” FSIS’s Federal inspection program. Before the Secretary initiates the Federal designation process that results in State establishments being subject to the Federal inspection program, FSIS and the State agency confer on the State MPI program’s deficiencies. If the State MPI program is unable to meet the “at least equal to” requirements or if its responsible officials are unwilling to do so, the Secretary of Agriculture notifies the Governor of the State that the State does not have an “at least equal to” MPI program and is not in compliance with the cooperative agreement between FSIS and the State, and is subject to the Federal designation of its MPI program. If deficiencies are not resolved, the Secretary will designate the State MPI program for Federal meat and poultry inspection and publish a notice of the designation in the Federal Register. Upon the expiration of thirty days after the publication of the Federal Register notice the State-inspected establishments will become subject to Federal inspection. VI. APPEAL PROCESS State officials have the right to appeal any program status determination made by FSIS. The appeal process follows the Office of Investigation, Enforcement and Audit’s (OIEA) chain of command. The chain of command ensures that Agency employees most familiar with the facts of the appeal will perform the initial evaluation of the appeal. The Appeal process gives State officials the right to appeal to the next highest level if not satisfied with the outcome. The OIEA chain of command is: 1) FSIS employee who made the finding (e.g., FSAB Program Auditor); 2) FSAB Team Lead; 3) FSAB Chief; 4) Management Controls and Audit Division (MCAD) Director; 5) OIEA Deputy Assistant Administrator; 1 Directive 5710.1, Designation of States for Federal Meat or Poultry Inspection, outlines the procedures for designation of States for Federal meat or poultry inspection. Page 14', '6)OIEA Assistant Administrator; and 7)FSIS Administrator. VII.FSIS REPORTS The State MPI program officials are notified in writing when FSIS makes a determination after analysis of the self-assessment and on-site review, as applicable. An individual end-of-year report is sent to each State MPI program summarizing program findings. Additionally, each year FSIS publishes on its Web site an overall end-of-year summary report of the findings and final determinations for all State MPI programs at http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/inspection/state-inspectionprograms/state-inspection-and-cooperative-agreements/reviews-of-state-programs VIII.NINE PROGRAM COMPONENTS Criteria for “at least equal to” determination State MPI programs need to have meat and poultry inspection laws and regulations that impose mandatory ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection, reinspection, sanitation requirements, recordkeeping requirements, and enforcement authorities “at least equal to” those prescribed by the FMIA2 (21 U.S.C. 601, et seq.) and PPIA 3(21 U.S.C. 451, et seq.). State MPI programs need to also enforce requirements that are “at least equal to” those imposed under the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act of 1978 (HMSA)4 (7 U.S.C. 1901, et seq.). 2 The Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601, et seq.) governs the slaughter of livestock and the processing and distribution of meat products in the United States. Passed by Congress in March 1907, the FMIA authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to set national standards for meat inspection. The FMIA was amended in the Wholesome Meat Act of 1967, granting the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to authorize each State to develop its own meat inspection program if their requirements are “at least equal to” Federal requirements. The amended FMIA assures uniformity in regulation of products shipped interstate, intrastate, and in foreign commerce. 3 The Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 451, et seq.) governs the slaughtering, processing, and distribution of poultry products in the United States. Passed by Congress in August 1957, the PPIA authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to make rules and regulations setting national standards for poultry inspection. The PPIA was amended in the Wholesome Poultry Products Act of 1968, granting the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to authorize each State to develop its own poultry inspection program if their requirements are “at least equal to” federal requirements. The amended PPIA assures uniformity in regulation of products shipped interstate, intrastate, and in foreign commerce. 4 The Humane Methods of Slaughter Act (7 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.) governs the humane treatment of animals at official establishments. Passed by Congress in 1978, the HMSA authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to make rules and regulations setting national standards for livestock inspection. The HMSA prevents needless suffering of animals, Component 1: Statutory Authority and Food Safety Regulations Page 15 Component 1: Statutory Authority and Food Safety Regulations', 'State MPI programs need to also be in compliance with Federal Civil Rights laws: • Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 200 (d)]; • Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as Amended (29 U.S.C. 794); • Age Discrimination Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101, et seq.); • Applicable USDA Civil Rights regulations; • Financial Accountability requirements pursuant to the Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments (7 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 3016), (previously known as the Common Rule); • The Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments (7CFR Part 3016), (previously known as the Common Rule); and • FSIS Directive 3300.1, Rev. 2, Fiscal Guidelines for Cooperative Meat and Poultry Inspection Programs. To ensure States are in compliance with the statutory and regulatory requirements detailed above, State MPI programs need to: • Adopt by reference the FMIA, PPIA, and HMSA and implementing regulations; or impose State laws that meet the “at least equal to” requirements of the FMIA, PPIA, and HMSA, and explain in their submission to FSIS how those requirements provide a level of protection that is “at least equal to” that which is imposed by the FMIA, PPIA, HMSA and implementing regulations FSIS allows time for the State’s rulemaking process when necessary, because there are States that have legislatures that do not always meet on an annual basis. The State MPI program needs to ensure there are measures in place to verify compliance and take enforcement actions for non-compliance findings until the final rulemaking process has been completed. The State MPI program needs to have the authority to expedite the rulemaking process in a manner “at least equal to” that provided for in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §553. If a State MPI program has enacted its own comparable State statutes and regulations that are “at least equal to” those governing the Federal inspection requirements, it needs to ensure that the statutes and regulations establish requirements that State produces safer and better working conditions, brings about improvement of products and economies, and produces other benefits for producers, processors and consumers. Nothing in the HMSA shall be construed to prohibit, abridge, or in any other way hinder the religious freedom of any person or group. Page 16', 'establishments maintain sanitary conditions and operate in a manner that includes evaluating hazards, taking steps to control hazards, and routinely verifying that product is safe, wholesome, not adulterated, and properly marked and labeled. States need to ensure that their statutes and regulations adequately address, in an “at least equal to” manner, mandatory ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection, reinspection, sanitation requirements, recordkeeping requirements, compliance provisions, and enforcement authorities to ensure that product is wholesome and not adulterated. In addition, State regulations need to address the humane treatment of animals at establishments under inspection. Outcome The expected outcome is a set of laws and regulations in place that, when objectively reviewed by FSIS, are determined to be “at least equal to” FSIS’s Federal laws and regulations. “At least equal to” Requirements State MPI program officials need to stay current with applicable laws, administrative rules, FSIS regulations, FSIS directives and notices, and any other policies, and be able to explain how their State programs are “at least equal to” FSIS’s Federal inspection program requirements. The State officials should include a narrative that describes any changes in the State laws and regulations over the past 12 months, and of any proposed changes that may affect their “at least equal to” status over the subsequent 12 months. Objective State MPI programs need to periodically review applicable State laws, regulations, FSIS Directives and Notices and other FSIS policies to ensure the State programs provide a level of protection that is “at least equal to” those imposed by FMIA, PPIA, HMSA and regulations in section 9 of the CFR. Statutory Authority and Food Safety Regulations Methods and Procedures State MPI programs need to have methods to periodically evaluate changes to Federal laws and regulations for applicability to State MPI programs, and need to revise State MPI laws and regulations as necessary. The methods should, at a minimum, address the following critical aspects: • Procedures for periodic evaluation of changes to applicable laws and regulations; • State legislative procedures; • State emergency legislative procedures; Page 17', '• State rulemaking procedures; and • State emergency rulemaking procedures. Evidence of system application State MPI programs should provide evidence which demonstrates implementation of methods and procedures that are “at least equal to” those of FSIS’s Federal inspection program. At a minimum, the State MPI program should submit: • Documentation of periodic evaluations of current State laws, regulations and other policies; • The State laws and regulations applicable when species other than those covered by the FMIA and PPIA are considered amenable under State laws; • Current copies or Web links to State laws, regulations, and other policies with specific cross-references to 9 CFR; • Current copies or Web links to State rulemaking and emergency rulemaking procedures; • Documentation of laws and regulations currently undergoing State rulemaking and emergency rulemaking processes which affect the State MPI program; • Documentation that verify State laws are “at least equal to” the provisions of the FMIA, PPIA, and HMSA as specified in Attachment 2; and NOTE: The Statutory Side-by-Side Comparison Table (Attachment 2, page 19) has been provided as a tool for the State MPI programs to demonstrate comparable State statutes, laws, or regulations for each of the applicable FMIA, PPIA, and HMSA provisions. • Legal documentation that State MPI programs have the authority to impose meat and poultry inspection laws and regulations with the same purposes as the Federal laws that govern FSIS’s Federal inspection program.

The State system should have the capability to correct any deviations from regulatory requirements that may affect its program’s being “at least equal to” FSIS’s Federal inspection program. State MPI programs need to submit any supporting documentation (preferably completed reports and documents) to demonstrate the State inspection system, as described in the narrative, has been implemented, is functioning as intended, and will ensure the State MPI program has the ability to remain “at least equal to” FSIS’s Federal inspection program for the next 12 months. Inspection methods and procedures followed under a State MPI program must be “at least equal to” the FMIA, PPIA, HMSA, the applicable regulations in 9 CFR 300 to end, and applicable policies issued for FSIS’s Federal inspection program. At a minimum, the State inspection program should include the following criteria: • Ante-mortem A State MPI program is to examine and inspect all livestock and poultry before slaughter to determine whether animals are fit for slaughter and can be used for human food. A State MPI program should verify that establishments present all animals for ante-mortem inspection in accordance with the FMIA, PPIA, and 9 CFR, ensuring animals with abnormalities and signs that could otherwise indicate disease are removed from human edible food channels. • Post-mortem State Inspection Program Personnel (IPP) should examine and inspect carcasses in the slaughter process and post-mortem in State inspected establishments to determine whether carcasses and parts are wholesome and not adulterated and thus permitted to receive the State mark of inspection. Inspection of meat and poultry carcasses, including applicable parts, is conducted in a manner “at least equal to” FSIS’s processes, as described in 9 CFR 311 and 381, Subpart K, respectively. • Sanitation A State MPI program should verify that establishments have developed, implemented, and maintained Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures (Sanitation SOPs) consistent with requirements in 9 CFR 416. • Food Safety Requirements A State MPI program should verify each State inspected establishment’s food safety system, including Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) plans are consistent with requirements in 9 CFR 417. • Non-Food Safety Requirements A State MPI program should verify all products produced for distribution in intrastate commerce are wholesome, and properly labeled. State IPP need to perform the appropriate activities for verifying Component 2: Inspection Page 26', 'compliance with applicable requirements to those in the FMIA, PPIA, and 9 CFR. These activities include verifying accuracy of State inspected establishment product formulation for labeling and product standard of identity requirements; observing preparation or processing procedures; reviewing establishment records; and performing a variety of in-plant measurements and calculations. • Regulatory Enforcement A State MPI program should develop and apply administrative enforcement consistent with those in 9 CFR 500 (Rules of Practice) to ensure establishments are provided due process of law and bring noncompliant establishments back into compliance with the FMIA, PPIA, HMSA, and 9 CFR. • Exempt Facility Reviews A State MPI program should verify that all products produced in State exempt facilities (either in official State inspected establishments or a separate facility) comply with regulatory and statutory requirements for sanitation, adulteration, and labeling. • New Issuance Reviews A State MPI program should evaluate the applicability of new FSIS laws, regulations, FSIS Directives and Notices and any other policies, and ensure they are implemented, as appropriate. Outcome When objectively reviewed by FSIS, the State MPI program is determined to be “at least equal to” FSIS’s Federal inspection program. A State MPI program has: • A series of standards and policies that define how State inspected establishments can operate to produce safe, wholesome, not adulterated and properly labeled and packaged products. • A comprehensive State regulatory inspection system (e.g., Public Health Information System (PHIS)) that collects, consolidates, and analyzes data and enforces the meat and poultry regulations at State-inspected establishment. NOTE: State MPI program Directors that have elected not to use FSIS’s PHIS can find guidance information titled, “At least equal to” data system guidance for State Cooperative Meat and Poultry Inspection (MPI) Programs electing not to use Public Health Information System (PHIS) (Attachment 3, page 38). State MPI program Directors are to submit the requested data system information with the annual selfassessment submission to the FSAB for review. By August 1st of each year, FSIS will provide State MPI programs with guidance on the PHIS inspection tasks. • Assurances that State-inspected establishments can maintain food safety systems to reduce, eliminate, or prevent food hazards (i.e., any biological, chemical, or physical property that may cause a food to be unsafe for human consumption) Page 27', '• A system to carry out administrative actions when State inspected establishments are not meeting the provisions of “at least equal to” the FMIA, PPIA, HMSA, applicable State laws, and 9 CFR • A system to review exempt facilities to determine their compliance under the sanitation, adulteration, labeling, and other statutory and regulatory requirements • A system to evaluate the applicability of new FSIS policies and determine how to implement the policies in the State MPI program “At least equal to” Requirements The State MPI program is required to maintain: • A Slaughter Inspection System; • A Food Safety Verification System; • A Non-Food Safety Verification System; • An Exempt Facility Review System; and • A New Issuance Review System. NOTE: State MPI program Directors need to submit the data integrity information for the data collected and maintained in their system in place of the PHIS. The data integrity information should include: • The type of data maintained outside of PHIS (e.g., FSAs, custom exempt reviews, NOIEs); • How the data integrity is maintained (e.g., safeguards to restrict access, security tools); and • The State law or administrative rule that governs the security and integrity preservation of meat and poultry inspection program records. Slaughter Inspection System State MPI programs should maintain a slaughter inspection system that is able to verify whether State inspected establishments comply with requirements consistent with the FMIA, PPIA, and HMSA. The slaughter inspection system should have a method for assigning tasks and documenting task results for slaughter inspection requirements at State inspected establishments. The slaughter inspection system needs to be able to capture the results of ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection activities (e.g., suspected animals, condemned carcasses and parts) including the capability to capture any regulatory noncompliance and regulatory control actions taken. State MPI program officials should create or adopt slaughter inspection policies and procedures for conducting ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection activities that ensure compliance with Federal and State laws and regulations. Page 28', 'Objective To implement state inspection activities which ensure animals are suitable for slaughter; products are not adulterated, wholesome, properly labeled, marked, and packaged, and carcasses and parts are eligible for human consumption. Inspection Methods and Procedures State MPI programs should implement slaughter inspection methods and procedures “at least equal to” those of FSIS’s Federal inspection program. The methods and procedures at a minimum should include: • Methods and procedures to inspect livestock and poultry before slaughter (antemortem inspection) and verify that animals offered for slaughter have received ante-mortem inspection • Procedures to follow when State IPP observe animals showing symptoms of disease or abnormalities and signs that could indicate disease or other health conditions that would prohibit the animal from entering the food supply • Procedures to mark and document dispositions of livestock following antemortem inspections • Methods and procedures to inspect livestock and poultry after slaughter (postmortem inspection) to make and document dispositions of carcasses following post-mortem inspections • Procedures to verify State inspected establishments that slaughter cattle and establishments that process the carcasses or parts of cattle are complying with 9 CFR 310.22, requiring the removal, segregation, and disposition of specified risk materials (SRMs) • Methods and procedures used to document and maintain case files supporting administrative enforcement and other actions taken under the authority of FMIA, PPIA, and applicable State laws • Methods and procedures to assess whether slaughter inspection activities successfully meet the State MPI program management’s expectations for: • In-Plant Level Slaughter Inspections • Ante-mortem • Post-mortem • Noncompliance regulatory documentation • Enforcement actions • Product recalls (e.g., uninspected animals and carcasses) • Central Office Level Assessments • Administrative case development Page 29', '• Program personnel competency Evidence of system application A State MPI program should provide evidence that demonstrates the implementation of a State slaughter inspection system that is “at least equal to” that of the FSIS’s Federal inspection program. At a minimum, the State MPI program should submit: • Representative State Animal Disposition Summary/PHIS analogous reports that list animal and carcass dispositions performed within the last 12 months • Documentation of regulatory control, withholding, suspension, enforcement, or administrative actions taken when noncompliance is identified (e.g., Noncompliance Records (NRs), 30 day letters, Notice of Intended Enforcement (NOIE) letters, Suspension letters, or notification to withhold the marks of inspection) • Management’s evaluation and results of State slaughter inspection system performance Food Safety Verification System The sanitation criteria incorporate the regulations that address SPS, Sanitation SOPs, and HACCP, which are identified as essential parts of a food safety system. The regulations require that State inspected establishments maintain Sanitation SOPs and meet the SPS requirements. Sanitation SOPs are a prerequisite to an establishment’s HACCP plan, and establishments may use Sanitation SOPs to support decisions in the hazard analysis that certain hazards are not reasonably likely to occur. State inspected establishments may also maintain other prerequisite programs to support decisions in their hazard analyses. The State MPI programs are required to maintain a food safety verification system capable of identifying noncompliances in an establishment’s food safety systems. The State MPI system should have the ability to identify deleterious trends that occur in State inspected establishments’ food safety system (e.g., increased number of NRs, increased positive sample results), and should also be able to document the results of food safety verification activities, including regulatory noncompliance and regulatory actions taken. Additionally, State MPI program managers are required to adopt or create policies for conducting food safety verification activities to ensure compliance with Federal and State laws and regulations. Objective To implement food safety verification activities that ensure all State inspected meat and poultry products found in intrastate commerce are safe, wholesome, not adulterated and properly marked, labeled and packaged, and can verify State inspected establishments comply with applicable State laws, regulations and policies.

The State MPI programs need to ensure controls exist and are functioning as intended to maintain their operations over the next 12 months. Non-Food Safety Verification System5 The State MPI program should maintain a non-food-safety verification system that includes methods and procedures for verifying that State inspected meat and poultry products are wholesome, not economically adulterated, truthfully labeled, and meet the non-food-safety regulatory requirements. The system should also document identified noncompliances and regulatory actions taken. State MPI program managers should adopt policies for conducting non-food-safety verification to ensure compliance with Federal and State laws and regulations.

State MPI program managers should adopt or create policies for conducting reviews of exempt and poultry exempt facilities. Objective To ensure State exempt facilities comply with applicable State laws, regulations and policies. Exempt Facility Review Methods and Procedures State MPI programs need to implement review methods “at least equal to” those of FSIS’s Federal inspection program. The methods, at a minimum, should include: • A review of the State exempt operation to verify livestock and poultry carcasses and products are: • Not adulterated or misbranded • Handled humanely (livestock) • Prepared under sanitary conditions • Properly marked and packaged • Stored separately from State inspected products • Documented according to regulatory requirements • A method to assess whether the State exempt facility activities successfully meet the State MPI program management’s expectations Page 35', 'Evidence of system application A State MPI program needs to provide evidence that demonstrates implementation of an exempt facility review system that is “at least equal to” that of FSIS’s Federal inspection system. At a minimum, the State MPI program should submit: • Documentation and tracking logs for State exempt facility reviews • Management’s evaluation and results of the State exempt facility review system performance New Issuance Review System Objective The new issuances list is updated quarterly and is used to verify that State MPI programs are staying current with new FSIS policies. FSIS routinely issues regulations and notices in the Federal Register to communicate new policies and requirements to the public. FSIS also routinely issues Directives and Notices to Federal IPP to provide direction and guidance regarding inspection and enforcement activities. Each quarter, FSIS provides State MPI programs with an updated list of all applicable issuances published since the previous quarter. FSIS continues to provide this information in an effort to better communicate the “at least equal to” criteria for State MPI programs. State MPI programs are to review all issuances and incorporate any necessary modifications in their programs. State MPI programs are to submit a response to the Quarterly List of Applicable FSIS Issuances within 30 days after receipt of the list. New Issuances Methods and Procedures While State MPI programs are not required to follow FSIS issuances verbatim or to issue similar documents to their inspection program personnel, they need to consider the implications of each issuance and are expected to be able to explain their “at least equal to” actions (even if their decision is to do nothing) related to the activity or issue covered by the FSIS issuances. When a policy is issued by FSIS, State MPI programs need to have methods in place to determine the applicability of the policy to their State program, and decide how to communicate instructions for its implementation within their State inspection programs. The State’s results will be documented as a response to each new issuance on the Quarterly List of Applicable FSIS Issuances. For each new issuance, using one of the alternatives listed below, the State MPI program should document that the State: • Determined that the issuance has no application for its State MPI program maintaining its “at least equal to” status; the State should fully explain why; Page 36', '• Adopted essentially the same approach in its State MPI program; and submitted documentation demonstrating implementation; or • Adopted measures in the State MPI program that the State considers to be “at least equal to” FSIS’s Federal inspection program; provided the reason and justification for doing so, explained why and how they became convinced that they are “at least equal to” FSIS’s Federal inspection program, and provided documentation demonstrating implementation. Evidence of system application State officials need to be able to provide a justification for their “at least equal to” determination for each new Federal issuance. State MPI programs are to respond to the Quarterly List of Applicable FSIS Issuances sent on or before the first day of each quarter of the Federal fiscal year (e.g., October, January, April, and July) within 30 calendar days of receipt. The response should include a description of the methods used to distribute the issuances and evidence of delivery, and a summary of how the new issuance or policy change is being implemented. States should submit any documentation that demonstrates how each issuance was implemented. Examples of the manner in which issuances are implemented are included in the Quarterly List of Applicable FSIS Issuances. However, other documents may be used to demonstrate the implementation. States should enter information into the designated column on the Quarterly List of Applicable FSIS Issuances, and attach the responses to an email to the Federal State Audit Branch (FSAB) at: StateMPIProgramSubmissions@fsis.usda.gov, or by USPS, FedEx, UPS, or FAX (402-344-5104). Page 37', 'Attachment 3 “At Least Equal To” Data System Guidance for State Cooperative Meat and Poultry Inspection (MPI) Programs Electing Not to Use Public Health Information System (PHIS) I. PURPOSE To provide guidance to State Cooperative Meat and Poultry Inspection (MPI) programs electing to use a data system other than FSIS’s PHIS for meeting the “at least equal to” data system essentials. II. BACKGROUND The Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 661) and the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA) (21 U.S.C. 454) authorize FSIS to cooperate with State agencies in developing and administering their own Meat and Poultry Inspection programs. Individual State MPI programs are required to operate in a manner and with authorities that are “at least equal to” the ante-mortem and post-mortem inspection, reinspection, sanitation, recordkeeping, and enforcement provisions as provided for in the FMIA and PPIA. Therefore, State MPI programs are required to develop a data system with characteristics that can produce inspection and recordkeeping outcomes “at least equal to” FSIS’s procedures. FSIS maintains PHIS as its data system. FSIS developed PHIS to maintain detailed records of regulatory compliance verification activities. The activities are conducted by FSIS‘s Federal inspectors and the information is entered into PHIS by FSIS personnel at official establishments, official import establishments, and registered facilities. The PHIS database maintains establishment and facility data, and the results of inspection verifications. FSIS uses this information to identify issues that require Agency attention. PHIS supports documentation of appeals to inspection decisions, scheduling, and documentation of Food Safety Assessments (FSA) and the ability to identify and notify suppliers of beef products that have tested positive for E. coli O157:H7. FSIS uses PHIS to manage FSIS’s inspection assignments and FSIS’s employee assignments to roles and establishments. The PHIS sample scheduler distributes product sample requests to Establishment Task Lists. FSIS uses PHIS to apply business rules and risk-based algorithms for sample selection and output reports of scheduled samples. These scheduled sample requests tasks are performed by FSIS’s Federal IPP. FSIS uses PHIS to process information about imported products. FSIS’s Federal IPP input reinspection results for imported products in to PHIS. PHIS’s functionality includes a means for FSIS’s Office of Policy and Program Development (OPPD), International Equivalence Staff (IES) and the Office of Investigation, Enforcement and Audit (OIEA) Management Control and Audit Staff (MCAD) to schedule and track foreign country audit activities. Page 38', 'The information held in PHIS is shared with the Microbial (M2K) transactional database and the FSIS data warehouse. Information is written to the data warehouse from the PHIS transactional database to be used by other systems including the Enterprise Reporting System (ERS). The FSIS data warehouse provides a source of legacy system data which is used to support the analysis of inspection, audit, and assessment outcomes, and it maintains data from VetNet and PulseNet. FSIS analyses the data collected in PHIS through its regulatory verification, compliance and enforcement, and sampling activities to assess the appropriateness of policy design and policy implementation. The analysis informs further policy development. Additionally, FSIS uses the information gathered from data analysis to ensure that policy and program components are effective in meeting the FSIS’s public health goals and objectives. FSIS recognizes that an integrated infrastructure with high-quality data and feedback interaction is essential to a data-driven approach to inspection. A data-driven approach to inspection requires quality data collection methods, ongoing data analysis to refine analytical decision-making tools, and performance measures to assess the impact of policies and programs. The Task Library in PHIS supports the assignment of tasks to Establishment Task Lists. Each task is distributed to the Establishment Task List with a due date for completing the task. FSIS’s Federal IPP have the ability to schedule the assigned tasks by moving the tasks from the Establishment task List to the Establishment Task Calendar. FSIS designed PHIS to allow IPP the flexibility to decide on which days they will perform the tasks. Alerts are issued when specific events requiring immediate attention occur. Alerts are also used to remind FSIS’s Federal IPP to take a particular action, such as, acquiring a product sample for laboratory analysis. An alert consists of a “trigger” and a “notification” function. The trigger is a feature that automatically scans the data for a specific event, and upon finding it, issues the notification. The notification can take the form of an email sent by PHIS, a message on the user’s PHIS Alerts Dashboard, or both. PHIS issues Public Health Regulation (PHR) alerts when there is a pattern of noncompliance at the establishment. Each month the Office of Data Integration and Food Protection (ODIFP) uses the results of inspection tasks to calculate the PHR noncompliance rate for each meat and poultry establishment as well as egg products plants. A PHR alert is issued to FSIS’s Federal IPP when an establishment has a noncompliance rate that is elevated. Examples of other events that trigger alerts are: a large number of inspection tasks not completed at an establishment, high rates of noncompliance in an establishment, and a positive adulterant pathogen test result at an establishment (e.g., Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7 in raw ground beef, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) in beef manufacturing trimmings, or Listeria monocytogenes (Lm)/Salmonella in ready-to- Page 39', 'eat (RTE) products). The alert text gives directions to FSIS’s Federal IPP by pointing them to the appropriate regulations and directives needed for the response. PHIS Dashboard Alerts and e-mail notifications are issued to Headquarters and FSIS’s Federal IPP as events occur. The alerts and notifications provide FSIS’s Federal IPP and FSIS‘s Headquarters personnel with information that is important to the execution of their work assignments. The PHIS includes a set of standard reports available to all FSIS administrative levels. FSIS produces a wide range of PHIS reports. The reports are run by FSIS personnel on an as needed basis. The reports are run for specific time frames identified by the user. The reports are available to FSIS personnel based on their assigned PHIS role. So, District management teams see aggregated reports for a District while FSIS’s Federal IPP assigned to an establishment see reports for the assigned establishment. An example of a standard report is the monthly report of noncompliances by FSIS District Offices. Reports are used at all levels of FSIS to monitor operations, to identify areas needing corrective actions, and to communicate progress towards goals. Users can review the reports and identify results that require investigation and establishment response. PHIS reports provide FSIS’s Federal IPP and FSIS’s Headquarters personnel with information that is important to the execution of their work assignments. III. ELEMENTS OF AN “AT LEAST EQUAL TO” DATA SYSTEM To be “at least equal to” the FSIS’s system, the State MPI data system needs to: • Collect, analyze and respond to State inspected establishment and State MPI program data; • Monitor data streams to determine State inspected establishment performance; and • Respond, near real-time, to State inspected establishments that may pose a risk to public health To be “at least equal to” the State MPI data system needs to collect data from the following four activities: • Daily inspection verification activities at operating State inspected establishments • State MPI program HACCP verification testing • State MPI program in-depth food safety reviews • State MPI program administrative enforcement actions Set out below are guidance and recommendations for State MPI programs to use in developing their data systems if they choose not to participate in PHIS. State MPI programs should monitor data collected from the four activities listed above. The data collected should be compared to different data sets (e.g., data of multiple circuits, data Page 40', 'of multiple establishments, and data from previous months) and analyzed to determine whether the State MPI program is meeting program goals and objectives. State MPI programs should take appropriate actions, based on the analysis, when goals and objectives are not being met. 1. Daily inspection verification activities at operating State inspected establishments Data Collection State MPI programs need to collect State inspected establishment demographics (profiles). These profiles should include critical up-to-date information about the establishment’s size, products produced, production volume, recall history, noncompliance history, and food defense plans. HACCP information for the establishment should be available in the profile and include summary information, processing categories, food safety hazards, critical control points, and prerequisite programs. A State MPI program should ensure State IPP are able to verify that State inspected establishments’ profile information is accurate and current at set intervals (e.g., at least every thirty days or whenever the HACCP plan changes). NOTE: By August 1st of each year, FSIS provides State MPI programs with guidance on the PHIS inspection tasks. The FSIS PHIS Inspection Task Catalog will be updated annually to reflect current PHIS task information and then distributed separately as an addendum to the State MPI programs. Data Analysis The State MPI program’s data system should contain public health-based decision criteria to identify State inspected establishments requiring more frequent inspection activities (e.g., increased directed food safety verification tasks). The State MPI program’s data system should also include a mechanism to react to State inspection results. Examples of events or trends that would trigger the State MPI program to react to State inspection results include: • A large number of inspection activities not completed in State inspected establishments; • High rates of non-compliance in State inspected establishments; • A positive pathogen test result in State inspected establishments (e.g., E. coli O157:H7 in raw ground beef or Lm in RTE products) • Infrequent State inspected establishment profile updates (e.g., HACCP plan changes failed to be identified or documented) • Tasks are not being performed at frequencies sufficient to ensure the safety of public health Page 41', 'The State MPI programs should ensure data quality and accuracy so that the integrity of the information is not compromised (i.e., system identifying outdated establishment profile information or unperformed tasks). 2. State MPI program HACCP verification testing Data Collection The State MPI programs should maintain a system for tracking pathogen and residue testing results. Data Analysis The State MPI program’s verification testing system should contain public healthbased decision criteria to identify establishments requiring more frequent inspection activities (e.g., increased directed sampling due to positive sampling results or concerns with establishment’s production process). The system should include a mechanism to react to sampling results. Examples of events that would trigger the State MPI program to react to sampling results may include but are not limited to: • A large number of sampling activities not completed at State inspected establishments • A large number of laboratory discards • Positive sampling results in State inspected establishments for adulterant pathogens (e.g., E. coli O157:H7 in raw ground beef, STEC in beef manufacturing trimmings, or Lm/Salmonella in RTE products) • Violative residues • Identifying long-term processes that may have exceeded their schedule (e.g., a Salmonella sample set that has not been finished) 3. State MPI program in-depth food safety reviews State MPI programs should have procedures (e.g., Food Safety Assessments (FSA)) to verify that an establishment’s food-safety systems are effective and yielding products that are wholesome and not adulterated, properly marked, labeled and packaged. Data Collection A State MPI program system should track routine and “for cause” in-depth foodsafety reviews. Data Analysis Page 42', 'The State MPI program’s data system includes a mechanism to react to sampling and inspection results that could lead to a “for cause” in-depth food safety system review. Examples of events that may trigger the State MPI program to conduct a “for cause” in-depth food safety system review may include, but are not limited to: • State inspected establishments not in compliance with specific laws and regulations • A positive for STECs in raw ground beef or raw ground beef components • A positive Lm or Salmonella in RTE products or a positive Lm food contact surface sample • A Class I recall or a food-safety-related enforcement action (e.g., Notice of Intended Enforcement) that is not the result of an in-depth food safety system review • State inspected establishments that fail Salmonella or Campylobacter performance standards • A State inspected establishment that is the supplier of a product that tested positive for STECs in raw beef products • Human illness linked to a product from a State inspected establishment • A State inspected establishment that has a high level of public health-related Non-compliance Records (NR) 4. State MPI program administrative enforcement action State MPI programs should have procedures in place to initiate enforcement actions, as needed, to ensure food safety compliance. Data Collection The State MPI programs should maintain a system to collect data and facts to support administrative enforcement actions, and to track the results of actions taken (e.g., NRs, in-depth food-safety system reviews, intensified verification testing (IVT), suspensions, and recall information). Data Analysis The State MPI program’s data system should include a mechanism to react to the data collected in support of administrative enforcement actions. Examples of events that may trigger the State MPI program to take administrative enforcement actions may include: • Positive STECs in raw ground beef or raw ground beef components Page 43', '• Positive Lm, Salmonella, or E. coli O157:H7 in RTE products or a positive Lm food-contact-surface sample • A State inspected establishment that is the supplier of a product that tested positive for STECs in raw beef products • Human illness linked to State inspected product from an establishment (possible recall) • State inspected establishments not in compliance with specific State laws and regulations An explanation of the data system and supporting documents should be included in the annual State Self-Assessment that is submitted to the Federal State Audit Branch by November 1 of each year.

The narrative should identify the various chemical and microbiological sampling projects that are a part of the State MPI program’s verification sampling program. The State MPI program should ensure that the product and the production environment are tested for microbiological contaminants or chemical residues, in a manner that is “at least equal to” FSIS’s Federal sampling programs. NOTE: State MPI programs should not include any sampling activities (e.g., generic E. coli) conducted by establishments in the narratives. State MPI programs need to submit documentation that the verification sampling programs, as described in the narrative, have been implemented and have been functioning as intended over the last 12 months. Documentation should include factual information on the State’s ability to maintain its program for the next 12 months. State MPI program officials report laboratory sample results per sample project in an easy-toread format of the State MPI Program Sampling Activity Table (Attachment 4, page 5051). To be considered “at least equal to” FSIS’s Federal inspection program in its verification sampling program, at a minimum, the State MPI sampling program needs to include the following criteria: • Sampling Project Eligibility – State MPI programs consider product risk, product class, the product’s intended use, and production volume when determining the eligibility for each sampling project. State programs are to include the criteria for determining the scope of sampling, including the frequency of scheduled samples on an average basis per year across all applicable State inspected establishments. • Sample Result Analysis – State MPI programs analyze sample results for trends (e.g., samples collected but not analyzed, increased positive test results, and product non-availability for sample collection) that may influence program inspection activities. • Response Plan for Positive Test Results – State MPI programs have action plans for responding to positive results, including actions taken by the State MPI program to recall product (See Component 6) and prevent adulterated product from entering commerce. • Sampling Project Adaptability – The State MPI program’s sampling verification projects should be adaptable to keep pace with changes, such as emerging Component 3: Sampling Programs Page 45', 'pathogens, new products and processes, new or revised policies, and new laboratory analytical methods. By August 1st of each year, FSIS provides State MPI programs with guidance on minimum testing frequencies for small and very small establishments. State MPI programs need to maintain a verification testing program, with laboratory capacity, to address food safety (e.g., adulterants) and other regulatory requirements (e.g., standards of identity, species identification). The verification program needs to include more specific criteria for routine analysis for the following product classes: Raw Product • Adulterant • Shiga toxin-producing Eschericia coli (STEC) in non-intact beef or intact product used to produce non-intact beef • Violative chemical compound residues (e.g., antibiotic drugs, pesticides, etc.) • Measure of food-safety system process control • Pathogen reduction performance standards for Salmonella in certain raw meat and poultry products. • Pathogen reduction performance standards for Campylobacter in certain raw poultry products. Ready-to-eat (RTE) product • Adulterant • Salmonella in meat and poultry products • Listeria monocytogenes in meat and poultry products NOTE: Listeria monocytogenes is also a food-contact-surface and environmental contaminant associated with meat and poultry products. Thus, the sampling project (e.g., routine Listeria monocytogenes (RLm) sampling project) needs to address the post-lethality environment in which RTE products are produced. State MPI programs need to have the capability to conduct the following analyses as needed: Raw and ready-to-eat (RTE) product • Adulterant Page 46', '• Unexpected biological, chemical, or physical hazards sufficient to cause illness (e.g., allergens) • Misbranding • Significant nutrition labeling deviations • Central nervous system tissue in boneless meat derived from advanced meat recovery systems • Species not identified on the label NOTE: It is not expected that the State MPI programs have a special laboratory for atypical analyses (e.g., bovine tuberculosis), but rather, that the State MPI program be able to procure atypical analyses when needed. Outcome When objectively reviewed by FSIS, the State MPI Program is determined to be “at least equal to” the Federal inspection system. The State MPI program has a system for preventing products adulterated with pathogenic bacteria or violative residues from reaching the public through reliable and timely laboratory analyses of samples. “At least equal to” requirements State MPI programs should maintain a system for periodic verification of each State inspected establishment’s food-safety system. NOTE: State MPI program Directors are to submit the data integrity information for the data collected and maintained in a system elected in place of PHIS. The data collected may include State laboratory or contract laboratory sample test results. The data integrity information should include: • The type of data maintained in the State MPI program system elected in place of PHIS (e.g., FSAs, custom exempt reviews, NOIEs). • How the State MPI program’s data integrity is maintained (e.g., restriction to access the data, ability to track data changes). • The State law or administrative rule governing the security and integrity preservation of meat and poultry inspection program records. Objective To verify the effectiveness of each State inspected meat and poultry establishment’s food-safety system to ensure that only safe, wholesome, not adulterated, properly marked, labeled and packaged meat and poultry products enter commerce. Page 47', 'Verification Sampling Methods and Procedures State MPI programs need to apply verification sampling methods that are “at least equal to” those of FSIS’s Federal inspection program. At a minimum, to “be at least equal” verification sampling program methods need to: • Create sampling frequencies based on product risk, product type, production volume, time of year, product availability, etc. • Ensure current sampling projects include all State inspected establishments producing eligible products (e.g., raw beef non-intact, RTE post-lethality exposed (see 9 CFR 430)) • Ensure current sampling projects include all State inspected establishments slaughtering eligible livestock and poultry classes and use the Kidney Inhibition Swab (KIS™) test to screen for violative drug residues in applicable livestock NOTE: The KIS™ test can detect residues for Tilmicosin, Tulathromycin, Bacitracin, Penicillin G, Neomycin, and Sulfonamide. • Respond to public health concerns associated with products that test positive for adulterants (e.g., increase inspection activity, perform “for cause” FSA, conduct Intensified Verification Testing (IVT), initiate product recalls) • Respond to performance standard failures (e.g., based on Salmonella Performance Standards, Campylobacter Performance Standards) • Analyze sample results for trends (e.g., samples collected but not analyzed, increased positives results, product not available for sample collection) • Respond to adverse trends (e.g., adapting sample frequency, evaluate State inspection program personnel (IPP) understanding of sample collection) • Obtain serotype and Pulse-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns of positive pathogens (partner with FSIS) • Assess whether sampling activities successfully meet the State MPI program management’s expectation for: • Creating sampling frequencies • Sampling eligibility • Responding to positive sampling results • Managing positive pathogen results • State IPP competency Evidence of System Application Page 48', 'A State MPI program needs to provide evidence that demonstrates implementation of a verification sampling program that is “at least equal to” FSIS’s Federal inspection program.

State MPI program officials report the number of State-inspected establishments and number of State personnel performing duties, States can use the format of the State MPI Program Establishment Count (Attachment 5, page 59) and State MPI Program Employee Primary Roles (Attachment 6, page 60). State MPI programs are required to be “at least equal to” FSIS’s Federal inspection program. The Staffing, Training, and Supervision system at a minimum need to include the following criteria: • Daily Inspection Coverage – State MPI programs provide and maintain inspection coverage at State inspected meat and poultry establishments every day the State inspection marks are applied to products; at least once per shift at processing establishments and inspection on the line during all slaughter operations. • Employee Training – State MPI programs provide MPI employees with sufficient knowledge, skills, and training that provide them with the ability to carry out State meat and poultry inspection and compliance enforcement duties in a manner that is “at least equal to” FSIS’s Federal inspection program. • Supervision – State MPI programs provide direction to daily State inspection and compliance enforcement activities performed by State MPI program personnel. Outcome When objectively reviewed by FSIS, the State MPI program is determined to be “at least equal to” FSIS’s Federal inspection program in its staffing, training, and supervision systems. The State MPI program needs to have: • State inspectors that perform inspection activities at State inspected meat and poultry establishments, as required by State laws to ensure only safe, wholesome, not adulterated, properly marked, labeled and packaged meat and poultry products receive the State mark of inspection.

The State organization chart should include any personnel who are employed by other State programs outside of the State MPI program to assist in accomplishing their mission. In addition, the organizational chart should show supervisory boundaries and reporting lines of all State personnel involved. The submission of an organizational chart can provide the FSIS audit team with a clear understanding of how each State MPI program carries out its daily operational and administrative functions. Training Program Training and development of employees are key elements to the success of any organization. FSIS invests a considerable amount of time and resources in improving the skills of their workforce. State MPI programs need to have a State program in place to meet the training and development needs of their employees in a manner that is comparable to FSIS’s Federal inspection program. Objective To provide the necessary knowledge, skills, and abilities, through formal and informal training, to ensure personnel can successfully complete inspection and other critical job duties. Training System The training system should include methods that provide State MPI program employees with both formal and informal learning experiences that contribute to individual growth and improved performance in their assigned positions.

The system should have the capability to correct any deviations from regulatory requirements that may affect its program being “at least equal to” FSIS’s Federal inspection program in its humane treatment of animals. State MPI programs should submit supporting documentation (e.g. completed reports and documents) to show the State verification system (as described in the narrative, has been implemented) is functioning as intended, and ensures that the State MPI program remains “at least equal to” FSIS’s Federal inspection program over the next 12 months. State verification methods and procedures provided under a State MPI program are “at least equal to” the FMIA, PPIA, HMSA, FSIS Directives and Notices, Federal Register publications, regulations, and other applicable policies provided under FSIS’s Federal inspection program in its humane treatment of animals and good commercial practices with poultry. At a minimum, the humane handling system should include the following criteria: • Humane Slaughter – A State MPI program verifies all livestock are slaughtered in accordance with one of two humane methods specified in the HMSA or applicable State laws. • The first humane method requires that livestock be rendered insensible to pain on the first application of the stunning device before being shackled, hoisted, cast, or cut. • The second humane method is in accordance with the ritual requirements of any religious faith that prescribes a method of slaughter where the animal suffers loss of consciousness by anemia of the brain caused by the simultaneous and instantaneous severance of the carotid arteries with a sharp instrument. • In addition, State IPP are to verify State inspected establishments that slaughter poultry follow good commercial practices described in 9 CFR 381. Outcome When objectively reviewed by FSIS, the State MPI program is determined to be “at least equal to” FSIS’s Federal inspection program in its humane treatment of animals. A State MPI program has capabilities to ensure State inspected establishments humanely handle all livestock presented for slaughter and follow good commercial practices when poultry are slaughtered and processed on premises.

The methods and procedures at a minimum should include: • Methods to schedule and record humane handling tasks, and document noncompliance with the requirements consistent with 9 CFR 313 • Procedures to verify whether State inspected establishment personnel humanely handle all livestock presented for slaughter throughout the time they are on establishment premises • Methods to conduct and document humane handling verification reviews (e.g., District Veterinary Medical Specialist (DVMS) reviews) at livestock establishments and conduct poultry good commercial practices reviews at poultry establishments • Methods to assess whether slaughter verification activities successfully meet the State MPI program management’s expectation for: • In-Plant Level Slaughter Verifications • Humane handling Page 62', '• Good commercial practices • Noncompliance regulatory documentation • Enforcement actions • Central Office Level Assessments • Humane handling oversight • Administrative case development • Program personnel competency Evidence of System Application A State MPI program needs to provide evidence that demonstrates the implementation of a slaughter verification system “at least equal to” FSIS’s Federal inspection program in the humane treatment and handling of animals and good commercial practices with poultry. At a minimum, the State MPI program should submit: • Documentation of regulatory control, withholding, suspension, enforcement, or administrative actions taken when humane handling noncompliance is identified (e.g., NRs, 30 day letters, NOIE Letters, Suspension letters, notification to withhold the marks of inspection) • Humane handling verification reviews (e.g., DVMS analogous reports, in-depth supervisory establishment reviews) • Management’s evaluation and results of humane handling verification system performance Page 63', 'Criteria for “at least equal to” Determination Each State MPI program needs to submit a narrative describing the State’s compliance system used to enforce all applicable laws, regulations, and FSIS policies, and takes appropriate enforcement action in the event that misbranded or adulterated product is identified in commerce. The US Code Title 21, Sections 643, 644, 645 and 460 require businesses to register with the Secretary of Agriculture. FSIS compliance conducts surveillance reviews at these registered firms which may lead to investigations and enforcement actions. Under 21 U.S.C. 661 and 454, FSIS expects the States to impose “at least equal to” FSIS’s Federal inspection program assurances that affected individuals, firms, and corporations are complying with applicable State statutes when producing, transporting, storing, and distributing meat and poultry products in intrastate commerce. The State MPI program’s narrative should address and cite the State MPI program’s statutory authority for performing surveillance reviews, investigations, and taking enforcement actions at the following business types: If the State MPI program is not granted statutory authority under State law to review, investigate, or take enforcement actions for any of the business types above, the narrative should identify the State agency with the State’s statutory authority and cite the applicable statute. The narrative should also describe how the State MPI program cooperates with the authorized State agency when meat and poultry products are involved in the surveillance reviews, investigations, and enforcement actions. State MPI program officials may provide the narrative information in the plain language format of the Summary of Statutory Authority per Business Type, (Attachment 7, page 69) or another format. FSIS identifies the State MPI program as the State Agency responsible for coordinating with other State agencies to ensure all applicable compliance activities outlined in the guidelines comply with specified laws, regulations, and policies. This includes State or contract laboratories, health departments, law enforcement, State human resources division, and other State regulatory agencies. State MPI programs need to submit supporting documentation to demonstrate the compliance system, as described in the narrative, has been implemented and is functioning as intended, to ensure that the State MPI program remains “at least equal to” FSIS’s Federal inspection program in its compliance activities over the next 12 months. State MPI program officials may provide a report on compliance activities in a Component 6: Compliance Distributors 3D/4D operators Institutions Warehouses Salvages Restaurants Food banks Animal food Retailers Brokers Renderers Transporters Exempt poultry Page 64', 'plain language format of the Compliance Activity Report (Attachment 8, page 70) or in another format. State MPI programs are “at least equal to” the Federal inspection program in its compliance system activities. Compliance system activities need to include the following criteria: • Surveillance – State MPI compliance investigators conduct surveillance of persons, firms, and corporations operating in intrastate commerce who are subject to the provisions of the FMIA, PPIA, HMSA, 9 CFR, or State laws as applicable. • Investigation - State MPI compliance investigators conduct investigations of apparent violations, food safety incidents, or other allegations or incidents using the FMIA, PPIA, HMSA, 9 CFR, or State laws as applicable. • Product Control Action - State MPI compliance investigators take appropriate control of product found in intrastate commerce that may be adulterated, misbranded, or has not received the mark of inspection, and ensure proper disposition of such product (e.g., detention, seizure, condemnation, destruction). • Case Development and Referral – The State MPI compliance program is to include case development and referral mechanisms to take criminal, civil, and administrative enforcement actions, including sanctions, when firms and individuals violate Federal and State statutes. The State MPI compliance program recommends cases of criminal and civil violations for prosecution by the State legal system, or refers them to USDA, FSIS, OIEA, and CID for action. Outcome When objectively reviewed by FSIS, the State MPI program is determined to be “at least equal to” FSIS’s Federal inspection program in its compliance activities. The State MPI program has: • Assurances that affected individuals, firms, and corporations are complying with applicable State statutes or the Federal Acts when producing, transporting, storing, and distributing meat and poultry products in intrastate commerce • Documentation of surveillance activities, investigations, and enforcement actions (i.e., including sample collection that supports administrative, civil or criminal actions imposed against individuals or firms that have violated the State’s laws) “At least equal to” Requirements The State MPI program is expected to maintain: • A Compliance System Page 65', 'NOTE: State MPI program Directors need to submit the data integrity information for the data collected and maintained in a system elected in place of PHIS. The data integrity information should include: • The type of data maintained in a State compliance system elected in place of PHIS (e.g., Review and Compliance Records, LOW, ROIs, physical evidence). • Where the State compliance data is stored (e.g., server name, name of SharePoint or share drive, hard copy file cabinet). • How the State compliance data integrity is maintained (e.g., restriction to access the data, ability to track data changes). • The State law or administrative rule governing the security and integrity preservation of meat and poultry inspection program records. Compliance System The State MPI program needs to maintain a compliance system to investigate violations of food safety, food defense, and other consumer protection statutory requirements, and controls unsafe or violative products through detentions, seizures, and voluntary recalls. State MPI program managers should create or adopt State compliance policies for conducting surveillance and investigation activities, and the development of cases to ensure the imposition of criminal, administrative, and civil enforcement actions are in accordance with State laws. Objective To ensure State MPI program’s compliance activities are carried out in accordance with applicable State laws, rules and policies, ensuring all State inspected meat and poultry products found in intrastate commerce are safe, wholesome, not adulterated, properly marked, labeled and packaged and all enforcement actions imposed are legally supported. Compliance Methods and Procedures State MPI programs need to implement compliance methods “at least equal to” those of FSIS’s Federal inspection program’s compliance activities. The compliance methods and procedures should include: • Methods for conducting State surveillance and follow-up surveillance of individuals, firms and corporations operating in intrastate commerce subject to State laws, regulations and policies pertaining to meat and poultry inspection program • Procedures to prioritize State surveillance resources on intrastate commerce businesses with the highest public health risk Page 66', '• Procedures to determine the collection of raw ground beef samples for E. coli O157:H7 testing as part of the intrastate commerce surveillance activities at retail stores • Methods for conducting investigations of apparent violations, food safety incidents, other allegations or incidents subject to State laws, rules, and policies pertaining to the State meat and poultry inspection program • Procedures for State MPI program compliance investigators to collect, safeguard, and dispose of evidence in the performance of surveillance, investigations and other activities subject to the State laws, rules, and policies pertaining to the State MPI program • Procedures for State MPI program compliance investigators to follow when detaining or in preparation for seizing meat and poultry products found in intrastate commerce, when there is reason to believe that the products are adulterated or misbranded • Methods for preparing a report (e.g., Report of Investigation (ROI)) to support findings of apparent violations, food safety incidents, or other allegations subject to the applicable State laws • Procedures for the evaluation of case documents to support appropriate criminal, civil, or administrative enforcement actions (e.g., letters of warning, consent orders, fines, penalties, hearings) • Methods for the State MPI program to determine whether to recommend a product recall • Methods for documenting, prioritizing, and investigating consumer complaints directly related to State inspected meat and poultry products • Methods to assess whether compliance activities successfully meet the State MPI program management’s expectation for: • Surveillance • Investigation • Documentation and reports • Product recall • Consumer complaints • Compliance personnel competency Evidence of System Application A State MPI program needs to provide evidence demonstrating the implementation of a compliance system that is “at least equal to” FSIS’s Federal inspection program in its compliance activities. The State MPI program should submit: • Documentation and tracking logs for surveillance and follow-up surveillance activities of State MPI program compliance officers Page 67', '• Retail and investigative product sample results • Complete case files that include reports of investigation, evidence collected, notices of detention, notices of seizure, letters of warning, fines, consent orders, and documentation from legal proceedings. • Evidence preservation and chain of custody verification documents • Recall effectiveness checks, public notification of recalls, and other related documentation • Documentation and tracking logs for consumer complaints • Documentation and communications for surveillance reviews, investigations, and enforcement actions for the business types where the State MPI program is not granted statutory authority • Management’s evaluation and results of compliance system performance States can use the tables below to provide this information.

State MPI programs should update and maintain their laboratory microbiological and chemical detection methods so they are “at least equal to” FSIS’s Federal inspection program methods as detailed in the FSIS Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook. To achieve and maintain “at least equal to” laboratory methods, each State MPI program should meet the criteria in the following areas: • Laboratory Quality Assurance programs • Laboratory Testing Methods Outcome When objectively reviewed by FSIS, the State MPI program is determined to be “at least equal to” FSIS’s Federal inspection program in Laboratory methods. FSIS integrates ongoing documents and on-site reviews of the applicable analytical methods in its annual comprehensive review of State MPI programs. FSIS determines if a participating State MPI testing program is “at least equal to” the corresponding FSIS Laboratory testing program. “At least equal to” Requirements Sampling methods need to provide analytical results “at least equal to” corresponding FSIS testing programs. Each State MPI program should provide documentation through self-assessment and on-site review to demonstrate that its program includes the following: 1. Laboratory Quality Assurance (QA) Programs State MPI program laboratories, or contract laboratories, should have an appropriate QA program “at least equal to” the methods of FSIS’s laboratories to ensure the reliability and integrity of analytical results. State MPI program laboratories, or contract laboratories, should ensure that each laboratory meets the criteria outlined in the FSIS MPI Program Laboratory Quality Management System Checklist. A laboratory QA program assessment consists of the following: • Assurances for sample integrity and identity. Laboratories that analyze samples for State MPI programs maintain procedures to ensure that samples are not compromised within the laboratory. These procedures include a documented Component 7: Laboratory Methods and Quality Assurance Program Page 71', 'chain of custody as well as traceability to the sample, equipment, and critical supplies used to analyze the sample. • Demonstrated confidence in test results and an assurance that it does not resample or re-test pathogen-positive and non-compliant products • Documented program of quality control procedures and an assurance that these procedures are followed • Properly trained personnel; suitable facilities and equipment; and verified, calibrated, and maintained equipment in a manner consistent with international norms (e.g., European co-operation for Accreditation (EA) 04/10 or Analytical Laboratory Accreditation Criteria Committee (ALACC) guidance) • Appropriate proficiency testing schemes for food analysis • Use of validated method protocols • Reporting and recordkeeping capabilities that track and link a test result to the correct establishment 2. Laboratory Testing Methods Methods used in support of the State MPI program should be validated for the product type sampled and are to be “at least equal to” FSIS’s laboratory requirements. State MPI programs should provide documentation necessary to explain the methods used and the scientific basis for their selection. Such documentation should include detailed testing method protocols, supplemental testing procedures, and evidence of method validation and sustained proficiency testing for microbiology methods and sustained proficiency testing for chemistry methods. Evidence of analyst training in each subject method should be provided. Method assessment by FSIS considers the following: Microbiology • Methods of analysis are designed to detect the lowest possible level of stressed pathogens from State inspected meat, poultry, and environmental samples in accordance with current FSIS testing programs for each pathogen (e.g., the method includes an enrichment step, adequate enrichment time, immunobead capture step for E. coli) • Methods of analysis are validated through an experimental study. When methods are modified, it may be necessary to conduct a supplemental validation against a reference method (e.g., USDA FSIS Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook (MLG), FDA Bacteriological Analytical Manual, or International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standards). For validation studies conducted outside Association of Analytical Communities (AOAC), Association Française de Normalisation (AFNOR), the French national organization for standardization, or similar organizations, refer to FSIS Guidance for Test Kit Manufacturers, Laboratories: Evaluating the Performance of Pathogen Test Kit Methods at: Page 72', 'http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/966638c7-1931-471f-a79e4155ce461d65/Validation_Studies_Pathogen_Detection_Methods.pdf?MOD=AJ PERES • Methods of analysis detect the same pathogens as the corresponding FSIS MLG method. Alternative methods are inclusive for strains defined as positive by the biochemical, genetic, and serological confirmation tests described in the FSIS MLG. • Methods of analysis use appropriately-sized test portions or sampling methodology and frequency for samples offering enhanced opportunity for detecting foodborne pathogen contaminations. Information on the test portions used for FSIS testing programs is available at the USDA FSIS Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook website at the following link: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/science/laboratories-andprocedures/guidebooks-and-methods/microbiology-laboratoryguidebook/microbiology-laboratory-guidebook • Each method includes culture confirmation testing using a validated method. If additional non-validated confirmatory tests are performed by the laboratory, those tests are not be relied upon to invalidate the previous results. • Shipping enrichments to a second confirmatory laboratory is avoided. FSIS guidance for evaluating microbiological testing methods are found in the Establishment Guidance for the Selection of a Commercial or Private Microbiological Testing Laboratory at the following link at: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/464a4827-0c9a-4268-8651b417bb6bba51/Guidance-Selection-Commercial-Private-Microbiological-Testing-lab062013.pdf?MOD=AJPERES Food Chemistry • Methods of analysis are capable of measuring food chemistry components as a percentage of sample weight. Moisture, protein, fat, and salt are included. FSIS conducts limited food chemistry analysis of products at official establishments when in-plant inspection personnel believe the product is misbranded. • Acceptable methods of analysis are available on the USDA FSIS Chemistry Laboratory Guidebook website at: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/science/laboratories-andprocedures/guidebooks-and-methods/chemistry-laboratory-guidebook/chemistrylaboratory-guidebook • AOAC Official Methods of Analysis for food chemistry are also acceptable. • Alternative methods for food chemistry analysis are acceptable if they measure the same components with sufficient accuracy. Evidence to support the use of Page 73', 'an alternative method includes proficiency-testing data generated by the State MPI program laboratories or contract laboratories completing the analysis. The FSIS Accredited Laboratory Program (ALP) provides proficiency-testing services for food chemistry.

Page 86', 'OFFICE OF FIELD OPERATIONS (OFO) Resource Management and Financial Planning Staff (RMFPS) Procedures for the Preparation of Cooperative State Meat and Poultry Inspection Program Budget Submissions General Budget submission guidelines for the Cooperative Meat and Poultry Inspection (MPI) State programs are contained in the FSIS Directive 3300.1, Fiscal Guidelines for Cooperative Inspection Programs. The procedures below provide further details on the preparation of MPI program budget submissions. I. Current Year Budget Execution Analysis There are two components of the current year budget analysis: a) projection of current year expenditures for determination of fund availability for the current year, and b) determination of a basis for analysis of the budget submission for the ensuing year. A. Current Budget Execution Analysis 1. The analysis of the current year Cooperative State MPI program budget begins in June of each year. At that time, the Financial Reviews and Analysis Section, Financial Management Division requests that each State Agency to submit their estimated projection of the total current fiscal year obligations by object classes on the Budget Information form (SF-424A). 2. The data is utilized to determine a total projection of estimated fund utilization for all State MPI agencies. Annual estimates allow FSIS to determine any requirement for fund reallocation. B. Budget Submission Base 1. Data collected serves as an annual expenditure basis for comparison and analysis of budget submissions for the following year. II. Budget Submission for New Fiscal Year Each August, RMFPS prepares the budget call letter for the next fiscal year. Page 87', 'A. Budget Call Letter 1. The budget call letter is addressed to the head of the State agency for each Cooperative State MPI program, and is prepared for the signature of the Assistant Administrator for OFO. 2. The call letter provides specific guidance relative to operational and budgetary considerations that State agencies take into account when preparing the budget submission. 3. The call letter has many enclosures for presentation of the budget submission: a. Application for Federal Assistance (SF-424) - Attachment 2-2 b. Budget Information – Non-Construction Programs (SF-424A) - Attachment 2-3 c. Assurances – Non-Construction Programs (SF-424B) - Attachment 2-4 d. State Assignment and Employment Report (FSIS Form 5720-5) - Attachments 2-6 e.

Budget Submission Form Requirements FSIS forms 5720-4 and 5720-5 are prepared prior to filling out the other forms. 1. Form SF-424 (Application for Federal Assistance) Note that section 15, Estimated funding is consistent with form SF-424A. 2. Form SF-424A (Budget Information – Non-Construction Programs) The amounts in form SF-424A are consistent with the data contained in forms 5720-5 and SF-424. The activities to be used for “Grant Program Function or Activity” are in-plant, Compliance, Laboratory and other. Costs in section B of Form SF-424A are reported by Object Class Category as follows: a. Personnel costs are salaries for State permanent full time (PFT) and other than permanent (OTP) personnel including base salaries, overtime, holiday pay, differentials, lump sum payments and annual and sick leave payments. Costs for contract veterinarians should appear in “Contractual.” b. Fringe Benefits are costs paid on behalf of State employees, including retirement, social security, insurance, clothing allowances, relocation benefits, workmen’s compensation, etc. This object class is calculated as a percentage of salary based on historical data or by using the latest payroll information available. Page 88', 'c. Travel provides for travel costs incurred by State employees in the performance of their assigned duties whether paid directly by the State or reimbursed to the employee. Some items used in determining overall travel costs are: mileage costs based on the estimated miles to be traveled times the rate per mile (the state approved mileage rate or latest approved Federal rate, whichever is lower); vehicle rental costs; motor pool costs; auto leases; repairs for State vehicles; auto insurance; and depreciation. Other allowed expenses include per diem, subsistence, and meal allowances. d.

Management of State MPI Directors Contact List OPD manages and keeps an up-to-date list of Agriculture Commissioners and MPI Directors for the 27 States that have their own meat and poultry inspection programs, as well as the States in which FSIS has entered into cooperative agreements with to conduct reviews of custom exempt slaughter and processing operations for OFO. This list is maintained on FSIS’s Web site at: www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/inspection/state-inspection-programs/stateinspection-and-cooperative-agreements/state-officials. Page 92"", 'Monthly State MPI Program Directors Correlation Webinar OPD coordinates a monthly Webinar with all 27 State MPI Directors and their personnel to discuss new FSIS policies and any other issues that States need to know to maintain “at least equal to” status to FSIS’s Federal meat and poultry inspection programs. OPD, in conjunction with FSAB and other FSIS programs encourage States to provide issues or topics that need further clarification before the monthly scheduled Webinar so that the appropriate FSIS subject matter experts can provide updates and answer questions. OPD solicits topics from the State MPI Directors for upcoming Webinars; however, State personnel are also welcome to submit suggestions for Webinar topics through the Small Plant Help Desk. Management and Renewal of Federal and State Cooperative Agreements The FMIA and PPIA allow FSIS to cooperate with State agencies in developing and administering their own MPI programs. OPD administers the base cooperative agreements between FSIS and the individual States to operate their “at least equal to” meat and poultry inspection programs. Provided the State continues to operate it’s “at least equal to” program in good standing, these cooperative agreements are renewed on an annual basis through OPD. OPD administers, and renews, the Tallmadge-Aiken (TA) and Cross Utilization (CU) agreements with States that provide inspection coverage for FSIS-regulated establishments, as well as the Cooperative Interstate Shipment (CIS) agreements where State-inspected establishments can sell product outside of their respective State boundaries and in foreign commerce. OFO has direct oversight of these three programs, and ensures that State inspection personnel assigned to any TA, CU or CIS establishment have received FSIS-conducted training. OPD assists the States that have these programs by ensuring their personnel are registered in the required FSISconducted training courses and providing both the States and OFO with the pass/fail results of the State employees. There are several other unique cooperative agreements that OPD administers and renews based on OFO’s needs. There is a cooperative agreement with Utah’s Egg and Poultry Grading Program to have Utah State Inspectors provide continuous inspection in several of FSIS’s egg products inspection plants. Furthermore FSIS has cooperative agreements with California and Colorado for their personnel to conduct reviews of custom exempt slaughter and processing operations within those respective States, which are procedures that OFO would normally perform. Directors seeking advice or assistance with State MPI programs, or wishing to obtain copies of current and archived cooperative agreements, are welcome to contact OPD through the Small Plant Help Desk. Page 93', 'Training OPD provides assistance to the State programs by ensuring they receive course announcements from FSIS and any assistance to State personnel in securing enrollment in the classes they might need. This service is especially essential for the States that have TA, CU or CIS programs where their personnel must have successfully completed FSIS trainer-led courses in order to conduct inspection activities within TA, CU or CIS establishments. OPD provides both the States and OFO with the pass/fail results of the State employees. Furthermore, OPD assists States by providing CDs, DVDs, or other hard copy resources on food safety and public health-related training materials for reference offered through FSIS’s Center for Learning. Many of these titles are interactive computer-based training on disk. State personnel can request a copy of the catalog and submit any orders through the Small Plant Help Desk, since the online catalog is only available through FSIS’s Intranet site, which the States cannot access.

CID assists and encourages State Compliance programs in assuming full responsibility for and jurisdiction over the enforcement of meat and poultry laws within States. State Compliance programs assist CID in coordinating and channeling various State efforts into a comprehensive national compliance program. The coordination of CID and State Compliance programs necessitate close communications in administration of the respective programs. The compliance personnel of CID and State Compliance programs are cross-utilized fully to inquire into alleged violations, conduct compliance reviews, develop evaluation material, and make necessary contacts with the various Federal, State, County, or Municipal officials and informants. When there is overlapping jurisdiction and authority, compliance personnel of either CID or State Compliance programs are authorized to handle the matter and represent fully both Federal and State interests. CID and State Compliance programs are encouraged to refer cases dependent on resources to obtain optimal results. These operational details are resolved on a caseby-case basis between CID and State Compliance programs. CID training programs are open for participation by members of both groups to the extent possible and feasible.

The standards provide the overall framework for establishing and maintaining internal control and for identifying and addressing major performance and management challenges in areas at greatest risk of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-123, Management Accountability and Control, revised June 21, 1995, provides the specific requirements for assessing and reporting on controls. As a result, Federal program managers continually seek better ways to achieve agencies’ missions and program results. In other words, they seek ways to improve accountability. A key factor in helping achieve such outcomes and minimize operational problems is to implement appropriate internal control. Effective internal control helps manage change to cope with shifting environments and evolving demands and priorities. The term internal control is synonymous with the term management control (as used in OMB Circular A-123) that covers all aspects of an agency’s operations (programmatic, financial, and compliance). Recently, other laws have prompted renewed focus on internal control. The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 requires agencies to clarify their missions, set strategic and annual performance goals, and measure and report on performance toward those goals. The internal control system helps the program’s management to provide reasonable assurance of the effectiveness and efficiency of operations, of reliability of financial reporting, and of compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Terminology The following includes definitions for commonly used terms of the Federal management control systems: Risk Assessment - Internal control provide for an assessment of the risks the agency faces from both external and internal sources. A precondition for risk assessment is the establishment of clear and consistent agency objectives. Risk assessment is the identification and analysis of relevant risks associated with achieving the objectives, such as those defined in strategic and annual performance plans developed under the Government Performance and Results Act, and forming a basis for determining how risks is managed. Page 97', ""Internal Control (Management Control) - An internal control is comprised of control activities, control document (control), and performance measures (i.e., performance standards or action level). Control - Control documents (control) provide direction to program personnel for the execution of the control activity to meet the expectation of the program’s management. Controls are policies, procedures, techniques, and mechanisms that enforce management’s directives, such as the process of adhering to requirements for budget development and execution. Controls are clearly documented, and the documentation is readily available for examination. The control document is measurable and appears in management directives, administrative policies, or operating manuals and may be in paper or electronic form. All documentation and records are properly managed and maintained. Control Activity – Internal control activities help ensure that management's directives (mission and strategic goals) are carried out. Control activities are effective and efficient in accomplishing the agency's control objectives. They help ensure that actions are taken to address risks. Objective of Control Activity - Objective of control activity specifies the purpose for program in executing a control activity. The purpose of the control activity directly relates to and supports the program’s mission and strategic goals. Implementation (Monitoring) - Internal control monitoring assesses the quality of the control activity performance over time and ensures the findings of audits and other reviews are promptly resolved. Performance Measure - A performance measure (i.e., performance standard or action level) is an indicator of the effectiveness and efficiency of a control activity. Programs need to establish activities to monitor performance measures. These activities may include comparisons and assessments of different sets of data to one another and the performance measures to analyze the relationships so conclusions can be made and appropriate actions taken. Controls are aimed at validating the correctness and integrity of the performance measures. Page 98"", 'Management Control Helper Questions Key Function (Functional Area) • Why do we exist?
