Furthermore, countries that are not eligible to export raw product directly to the U.S. (e.g., due to USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) animal disease requirements), but are eligible to use their own raw source materials to produce processed products are required to certify and list the establishments providing the raw source materials. Lastly, when listing an establishment that provides raw source material, please clearly identify the establishment as a source establishment on the certified establishment list. The reporting table below may be used to assist CCAs with providing the required information to FSIS by May 18th of each year. The format of the table is optional; however, the information noted with an asterisk (*) is required to be sent to FSIS annually. For each certified establishment, CCAs should only include products that the country is currently eligible to export to the U.S., including raw source materials for further processing. In addition, if your country is prevented from exporting certain meat, poultry, or egg products to the U.S. due to an APHIS animal disease requirement, FSIS requests that the CCA clearly identify the product categories and product groups that each certified establishment intends to export to the U.S. To view which products your country is currently eligible to export to the U.S., refer to FSIS Import Library- Eligible Countries and Products. For a list of product categories and product groups, please refer to the FSIS Product Categorization Guide. Certified establishments that are no longer eligible to export products to the U.S. must be identified as delisted on the list provided to FSIS. Furthermore, FSIS requests that CCAs inform FSIS of any establishment delistment within 90 days. CCAs can submit the required information to FSIS by either uploading it into our Public Health Information System (PHIS) under question 4 of the 2019 self-reporting tool (SRT), or by submitting it to our International Coordination Executive at: US Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service, Office of International Coordination, Room 3143 South Building, 1400 Independence Ave SW, Washington D.C. 20250-3700 E-mail: InternationalCoordination@usda.gov Date¹* Eligibility Status ²* Establishment Number* Establishment Name* Establishment Address* Type(s) of Operation³* Process Category⁴* Species⁵ * Product Category Product Group MM/DD/YYYY 1. Date – The date of an establishment’s initial certification, delistment, or relistment. 2. Eligibility Status – If an establishment listed on the previous year’s certified establishment list remains eligible to export products to the U.S., please leave this field blank. • New - Establishments that are newly certified as eligible to export products to the U.S. that were not previously certified as eligible to export products to the U.S. • Delisted – Establishments that were previously certified as eligible to export products to the U.S. and are no longer eligible to export products to the U.S. • Relisted – Establishments that were previously delisted and have been relisted as certified as eligible to export products to the U.S. 3. Type(s) of Operation – Slaughterhouse, Non-Slaughter Processing, Egg Processing, Cold Storage, Exporting Warehouse, or Source Establishment. • Slaughterhouse – Establishments where healthy, live animals are humanely slaughtered under sanitary conditions to produce meat or poultry products for human consumption. • In slaughter operations, FSIS requires continuous government inspection during slaughter activities to ensure that each and every livestock carcass, head, and viscera and each and every poultry carcass and viscera are inspected. • Non-Slaughter Processing - Operations include all non-slaughter activities, including but not limited to, boning, cutting, slicing, grinding, injecting, pumping, filleting, breading, adding ingredients through other mechanical means, formulating, cooking, smoking, cooling, assembling, and packaging.', 'FSIS Guidance for a Suggested Reporting Table for the Certified Establishment List 2 • In processing operations (i.e., non-slaughter), FSIS requires that a government inspector be on the premises and performing inspection activities at least once per production shift during processing operations. The requirement for government inspection once per production shift during processing operations is not the same as inspection once daily; therefore, if an establishment has more than one production shift per day during which it produces product for export to the U.S., a government inspector must be present at least once during each production shift. • Egg Processing - Manufacturing of egg products, including breaking eggs, filtering, mixing, blending, pasteurizing, stabilizing, cooling, freezing, drying, or packaging egg products at certified establishments. • Cold Storage – Facility that receives and stores meat, poultry, or egg products from certified establishments and maintains products under refrigeration until export to the U.S. • Exporting Warehouse – Facility that receives and stores meat, poultry, or egg products from certified establishments until export to the U.S. Additionally, the facility where export verification and certification services for exports are provided. • Source Establishment - Slaughter establishment that provides raw source materials to certified establishments for the production of processed products intended for export to the U.S. Source establishments are not eligible to export product directly to the U.S. due to disease restrictions, regionalization, product ineligibility, or other reasons. However, source establishments must meet all U.S. requirements, be certified by the CCA, and be identified as a source establishment on the certified establishment list. 4. Process Category – 1. Raw – Non Intact 4. Not Heat Treated - Shelf Stable 7. Heat Treated - Not Fully Cooked - Not Shelf Stable 2. Raw - Intact 5. Heat Treated - Shelf Stable 8.
